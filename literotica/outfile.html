<p>The large male naked body padded as silently through the deserted corridors of the spaceship as would have been achieved in the savannahs or jungles of his homeworld. Nudity wasn't an issue. All the crew were male and the naked being knew where each one of them was at that time. That included the location of the one he now stalked. The male caught a glimpse of himself in a polished surface; a little over six feet tall, solid, muscular, powerful chest, thighs and upper arms only hinting of the real strength and power of the male. A mix of dark and slightly lighter hair reached to their shoulders. The two-tone hair also dusted their arms and legs, but his chest was hair free to display the muscles to best advantage. He flexed his large hands and checked his retractable claws and gave his image a feral smile to see strong, somewhat sharp, healthy teeth. His bright blue eyes appeared amber in the ship's muted light. When stalking prey, bright lights could hinder rather than help. The muted lighting was to his advantage.</p><p>Whether his intended victim was prepared to be a willing participant didn't register in the big male's mind. He needed to mate, to sheath his body in hot tight heat. He glanced down at the furred pouch at his groin. The engorged head of his sex was beginning to emerge. The pouch protected his genitals; keeping them hidden when naked as well as immobile should speed be necessary. However, at the moment anticipation was fuelling arousal. He growled an order to the ship's Artificial Intelligence. Stealth mode ensured doors opened silently and the male wanted to be as close as possible to his intended when he made his move. Many of his species enjoyed the extra stimulus of a prolonged chase before subduing their prey and under the right circumstances; it was pleasurable for him, too. However it was neither the place nor the time for such extra activities. Here, now a swift attack from a camouflaged approach would work best.</p><p>****</p><p>The young man was alone on the bridge of the spaceship. As far as he was aware only he and the ship's AI were on duty. There had been a message earlier and he expected the return of the ship's commander. If not for that ... there were more pleasurable pursuits than sitting watching space no matter how beautiful the sight. He sighed pushing away such thoughts. He had agreed to watch and wait - his decision. He pushed a slender hand through a riot of auburn hair that hung to his shoulders. Oceanic blue eyes held a hint of loneliness and a pink tongue flickered out across sensual lips before retreating. He turned his attention to the long range scanners. He could just have AI notify him when anything came in distance, but this gave him a focus.</p><p>Bending over the scanners, the young man was unaware of the doors opening and the large male entering the bridge. The bigger man stared with appreciation at the way the smaller man's skin-tight suit moulded itself to the taut buttocks. Without hesitation he strode forward and had enfolded his strong arm around the slighter man's waist lifting him easily, covering the mouth to muffle the cry of alarm.</p><p>"Want you," he growled into the nearest ear. "Want you now."</p><p>With a flourish, he spun the slighter form and as the dazed young man tried to bring his senses under control, pressed their lips together. He pushed his tongue inside the young man's mouth as he gasped and mapped the inside with proprietary arrogance. He used one hand to yank down the bodysuit's fastener to hip level and pull the material to mid-elbow, trapping the slighter man's arms.</p><p>"Uist, no," came the panting pleas as strong teeth latched onto a small brown nub peeking through a covering a luxurious chest hair. "No," the sound was little more than a moan as the neglected twin nub was pinched in concert with the teeth that worked on its mate. As teeth switched between nipples, nipping them to an aching pebbled hardness, the throbbing matched another in the young man's groin.</p><p>"You would not mate with me?" the bigger male asked, stroking the harness he knew he would find between splayed legs.</p><p>"I'm...on...duty" the smaller man gasped as his flesh was skilfully caressed.</p><p>"AI," Uist commanded." Advise us immediately when a craft comes within range and increase bridge ambient temperature to 90F"</p><p>"Confirmed," came the low female voice of the ship's AI.</p><p>"Now your duty is to me, your mate," Uist whispered in the young man's ear. With what sounded like a purr he rubbed his head against the smaller man's body as he quickly divested him of the offending bodysuit. Licking and nipping indiscriminatingly at any flesh within reach, the bigger man backed the smaller to the command chair before spinning so that he was seated with the smaller man in his lap. He then kissed the unresisting form deeply before arranging the young man to sit straddling his powerful thighs.</p><p>"You're insatiable," the smaller man huffed affectionately kissing the tip of the bigger man's nose.</p><p>"It has been a whole day," the reply was little short of a whine. "You had left our bed this morning when I awoke and I had duties offship the rest of the day."</p><p>"I'm sorry, lover," the smaller man said kissing the almost pouting lips.</p><p>"I would have you mate with me," Uist said, his voice dropping low and husky, the need and desire evident.</p><p>"I love you, Uist and I need for us to mate, too".</p><p>"Love you, Sholto, love you always. Share yourself with me. Let me make us one."</p><p>"Yes," Sholto breathed</p><p>In Uist's homeworld, a warrior like Uist was always the Alpha whether in a same or mixed sex marriage. The Warrior caste, like that of the Priest and Royal castes was a prestigious caste to be married into and carried ceremonial responsibilities. Uist never subjugated his young human spouse. Sholto's intelligence and individuality had been a major part of the attraction. That he was as beautiful outside as inside was a bonus for the cat-man. Some on his world preferred their mate to be displayed as little more than a trophy if marrying into an exalted caste. Uist liked to show that in many ways, Sholto was his equal. On those ceremonial occasions where it was necessary, however, Sholto behaved impeccably complying unhesitatingly with all that was required of him. PrideHome had therefore welcomed the young human. Sholto had assured his mate that he considered himself privileged to have Uist as his husband and to occasionally have to demonstrably be Uist's Beta was a small price to pay for the happiness they shared. Outside of PrideHome, however, whilst the two men regarded each other as equals, there was no doubting that Uist was sexually dominant and Sholto was more than happy with the that situation. He loved his mate's dominance in bed.</p><p>"Show me you love me with your body, Uist," he begged softly. Words fled the smaller man as large hands began to pump the needy flesh jutting upwards from his groin whilst sliding between the spread crevice of his cheeks and ghosting across puckered flesh.</p><p>With a feral growl, Uist suckled a nipple between his teeth and worried the flesh until reddened and achingly hard, then lavished the same attention to its mate. Sholto writhed on his lap under the tender assault. Uist flipped open the left compartment of the command chair and located a tube without taking his eyes off his beautiful young mate. He opened it adeptly and squeezed cool gel over his fingers before sliding a thick, slickened finger between Sholto's spread cheeks. He rubbed sensitive flesh before allowing the finger to slide into hot tight heat. Sholto moaned softly at the erotic intrusion and kissed his mate, letting their tongues dance as Uist carefully prepared the small portal that granted him access to Sholto's body.</p><p>Uist helped the smaller man position his hard shaft against the glistening entrance to Sholto's body and holding the younger man's hips to help support his weight, Uist groaned as he was enveloped in Sholto's molten depths. The velvet channel gripped his sensitive flesh tightly and the smaller man panted as he slowly accepted Uist's solid rod. As he finally sat flush with the bigger man's groin, Uist held himself still awaiting his mate's acceptance of the long thick shaft. Finally Sholto began to undulate, letting the head of Uist's arousal rub the special spot deep within and he threw his head back and he ground and gyrated his hips to pleasure them both. Using his powerful arms, Uist raised and lowered Sholto onto the flesh that impaled him, relishing the look and cries of pleasure from the man he loved.</p><p>The scent of Sholto's passion and arousal inflamed Uist and his nostrils flared as he scented the air. His movements became faster, one hand reaching between their bodies to swirl the precome over his fingers before sucking them clean. He then began to pump the slender shaft of his mate in time with the upthrust of his own hips. Four direct strokes were enough to tip Sholto over the edge and he cried Uist's name aloud as his seed fountained over Uist's hand and their chests. The scent of Sholto's release was the undoing of the bigger man and he threw back his head roaring his completion as his seed pulsed into the still rippling channel.</p><p>As his sated organ softened and slipped from Sholto's heated depths, the bigger male took the opportunity to lay the smaller man across his lap and cuddle him close. With a low purr of pleasure he licked his hand clean of his mate's release then kissed Sholto's eyes, nose and cheeks before mating their mouths. As the kiss ended, Sholto sighed in contentment and then scowled. The scowl was completely ineffectual given his post-orgasmic flushed appearance. His face radiated joy rather than censure.</p><p>"I should be really angry with you," he said tapping Uist's nose with a forefinger. "I'm meant to be on duty, not letting my husband ravish me on the command deck."</p><p>Uist's happy sky blue eyes locked with his lover's deeper oceanic orbs and his smiled shyly.</p><p>"I missed you," he offered quietly. "AI was more than capable of scanning for Tristam and I missed you."</p><p>"I missed you, too, love," Sholto hastened to assure his husband cuddling closer to the imposing bulk of the bigger man. "But Rayner needed us last night and I knew once we were finally sleeping you would stay awake to ensure Rayner stayed asleep until deeply sleeping. I thought I would let you sleep in."</p><p>"I would rather lose sleep than time with you, mine. Your presence is the first thing I seek on waking and the last thing I gaze upon before sleep."</p><p>"Love you so much, my husband" Sholto murmured as he sought out one of his mate's large nipples, suckling contentedly on the thick nub. With his left hand he sought out its twin and gently pinched the fleshy nub in harmony with the suckling of its twin.</p><p>Uist demonstrated his appreciation with a low rumbling purr. His hand slipped between Sholto's thighs gently caressing and fondling his spouse's lax genitals. He was content to allow arousal to build more slowly this time and to savour it as it grew between them. He knew Sholto would still be sensitive from his previous climax and he didn't want the younger man to experience any discomfort during their intimate times. Minutes passed and Sholto was soon arching into Uist's hand desperate for a harder touch.</p><p><br/>"Need you, my own," Uist said roughly, the sight and scent of his aroused mate tearing at the fragile control he had.</p><p>"Take me," Sholto begged softly.</p><p>Moving swiftly, Uist lifted Sholto to lay him back on the command chair, flipping a switch that allowed the chair to recline almost flat. He hitched Sholto's thighs over the curved, cushioned arms and gazed with barely contained hunger at the smaller man to wantonly displayed to him. He ensured Sholto's hips were at the edge of the chair and pulled the taut buttocks apart and sheathed himself in the already slick passage. He balanced his upper weight on his arms either side of Sholto's head and began to pump the smaller man's erection in time with the pistoning of his hips. He nipped, licked and kissed Sholto's neck and throat as the slighter man bared his throat for his mate's teeth. As Sholto writhed beneath him, Uist bit down at the juncture of neck and shoulder to raise a mark of his passion and possession. Sholto moaned his approval and Uist felt the tightening of the beloved body that heralded his mate's imminent release. Uist pounded harder hitting Sholto's sweet spot repeatedly, his lover crying out with pleasure, hands fisted in Uist's hair rhythmically clenching and unclenching with Uist's thrusts. With a scream of Uist's name, Sholto arched as best he could under his bigger mate and a stream of pearlescent fluid hit their chests. Uist's roar was seconds later as he was milked by his mate's contracting channel, filling the smaller body once again with his seed.</p><p>As Uist tried to regulate his breath, he was aware that Sholto had passed out. He let himself slip from the haven of Sholto's body and proceeded to lick his mate clean. With a low growl of dark pleasure he lapped delicately at the stretched portal to taste the earthy musk of his mate overlaid with his own seed. Standing, he gazed with an indulgent smile at the boneless body and scooped the insensate form to cradle Sholto to his chest and await the smaller man's awakening. He was aware of the small movements as his mate began to awaken. Unconsciously Sholto pressed into the comfort and warmth of Uist's body. As he became more aware he gazed up at his husband. Sky and ocean met, bridged by love.</p><p>"Love you, mine," Uist rumbled possessively, tenderly stroking sweat-damp hair away from the beautiful face.</p><p>"Love you, my husband," Sholto replied, burying himself deeper into Uist's embrace.</p><p>The two men sat entwined, unconcerned about their nudity. The temperature was comfortable and after two explosive climaxes, Sholto was more asleep than awake held safe and content wrapped in his mates arms and love.</p><p>"Incoming message from Tristam to Silver Star," the voice of AI encroached into Sholto's drifting mind and unthinkingly, the young man started to his feet as the display screen shifted from star-dusted space to show the imposing figure of a strikingly handsome man.</p><p>Dark blond hair reached to broad shoulders and his eyes were a blue-grey of stormy skies. There was a small cleft in his chin that added to rather than distracted from his appearance. Although only visible to just below his shoulders, he emanated physical power and presence.</p><p>"Tristam," Sholto cried aloud with delight. "You made it back early"</p><p>"Indeed," the older man agreed with a slight smile. "Did I arrive too early?" His smile widened into a full grin at the blank look from the nude young man. Sholto only understood the inference as Uist came to stand at his side, a large hand draping across his genitals, another pulling him to the bigger body. Sholto felt the blush start at his toes and suffuse his whole body, leaving his face a glowing pink.</p><p>"Uist, my friend, your mate glows with health."</p><p>"Indeed," Uist agreed with his own smile. "And it is always my pleasure to have him thus."</p><p>Sholto groaned and buried his face against Uist's bulk as the older man laughed easily.</p><p>"AI can see me safely docked..." Tristam began, unwilling to keep his friends and fellow crewmen from being together.</p><p>"We will wait till you are aboard. It is no hardship for us," Uist assured.</p><p>Tristam nodded, knowing he could rely on the cat-like male to speak truthfully to him.</p><p>"Rayner?" Tristam asked, his face turning anxious.</p><p>"He had a bad night last night, but stayed with us. He needed occasional soothing but then slept well. He has coped." Uist replied.</p><p>"Thank you, my friend," Tristam said, the sentiment heartfelt.</p><p>"I am the Protector of your mate as you are to mine. Even so, I would gladly guard his sleep as he is beloved to my mate and myself."</p><p>Tristam nodded, no words necessary.</p><p>"Just don't make a habit of leaving him," Sholto's muffled voice came from the vicinity of Uist's chest. "He does miss you terribly when he can't feel you."</p><p>"I miss him too," Tristam confirmed quietly. "You have my promise."</p><p>As Tristam made his way to the quarters he shared with his younger spouse, he thought of how their lives had started so badly and yet had led to their meeting. Tristam knew Rayner was the other part of his soul. Each man complimented and completed the other, to the point they shared a psychic bond that left Rayner distressed and himself desolate when they were apart and unable to 'feel' each other. In Tristam's case, his earliest memories were of a medical facility. His early memories wiped. He might have been intended as a sex slave, or a child for a childless couple. Instead his genes had been spliced. Some of the genetic material was that from PrideHome. He had been made to see and hear better than humans, better even than Uist. He was faster and stronger and was of above average intelligence, his mental abilities a par with his physical ones.</p><p>He had been rescued by Jameson Peters who at the time was the head of a special crime response team that covered not just earth, but allied worlds of the Planetary Federation. Something had 'clicked' when they had met and Jameson had used every ounce of his power, persuasion and that of his friends to ensure the seven year old Tristam was adopted into his family and not regarded as a freak to be exploited. Tristam had taken to both Jameson and his wife Aurora and had studied hard to repay their kindness and generosity. He watched as young children were often taken in on short term stays by the loving couple, but he was 'their' child.</p><p>When Tristam was fifteen, he had the single biggest life-changing event in his life. He had overheard Jameson talking to the chauffeur he used who was worried about a small boy that distant relatives of his wife had taken on. The boy had been orphaned and seemed to be having some problems dealing with the death and no-one wanted to give him the love and affection he would need. He was being passed around several, what the chauffeur considered, unsuitable couples and he feared for the boy. Smiling to himself, Tristam prepared himself to have another small child around. He wasn't prepared for the reaction on seeing that same small boy.</p><p>The boy was five or six at Tristam's evaluation as he saw the small bundle in his Papa's arms. Dark curly hair peeped out over the blanket in which he was wrapped. One arm was visible and Tristam felt anger welling up at the thinness of the limb. The skin looked dull, but Tristam was sure it would normally be a honey-tint. He felt a pull towards the child and found his arms reaching to take him from Papa's arms. At the same time the child turned and turned pain-filled sorrowful deep brown eyes upon the older boy. Tristam felt as though an empty part of his soul had been filled and tears sprang to his eyes as the boy reached for him. As he took the precious bundle, Tristam vowed he would die before he allowed harm to befall the child again. Extending his hearing as he spirited the boy away, he distantly heard Papa call him Rayner.</p><p>He washed the thin body and dressed Rayner in one of his own T-shirts. Mama had brought some milk and sandwiches and Tristam had sat with Rayner in his arms as the small child had eaten and drunk. Once the food had gone, Rayner had reached to hug Tristam and fallen asleep in the older boy's arms. He had taken Rayner to his bed and slept curled around the thin body. At some point he was aware of his parents entering the room. Recognising them, Tristam simply cuddled closer to Rayner and allowed sleep to claim him again as he heard Mama's voice.</p><p>"I think Tristam's found his soul-mate. It looks like we have two sons now."</p><p>Years had flown by and Tristam had never tried to lead his 'younger brother' into a relationship with him. They still shared a room together when Tristam was at home. It had been hard sometimes when he'd detected a quickening heartbeat or a surge of hormones scented with arousal from the younger boy when they were alone. But he determined that if their relationship were to deepen, Rayner needed to have made the decision for himself.<br/></p>

<p><b>Silver 2: Smoke and Mirrors</b></p><p>Eyes followed and heads turned in a mixture of admiration and lust as the stunning blond strode purposefully through the white sterile environment. Glances and murmured comments were ignored equally, nothing interfering with the sole focus of navigating their way through the indoor maze, which they were finding claustrophobic. The blond's long slender legs were encased in tight, green leather pants with a darker green tunic that barely skimmed their hips. The blond's long hair was secured behind elegantly pointed ears, cascading like a golden waterfall to the slim waist. The vision was both beautiful and ethereal. With a sigh of relief they finally stood outside a laboratory door. Golden eyes perused the signs of Private, No Admittance and Plague Control. A pink tongue lapped nervously at delicate lips. With a fortifying breath the blond rapped at the door and stepped inside.</p><p>The reptilian scientist looked up, surprised by the intrusion. No one except the overall scientist in control of the medical complex sought him out and then only after contacting him in advance. Although his medical expertise was desperately needed by the planet, many in the complex had a deep-rooted dislike of off-worlders; especially those whose appearance differed greatly from their own humanoid form. Although the world was trying to integrate with the myriad of other planets and peoples beyond their solar system, xenophobia was still ingrained in many.</p><p>The lizard man was tall and muscular, the baggy lab coat doing nothing to disguise the bulk and power of the male. His lips curled back over strong, sharp teeth and the frill around his neck changed from the varying hues of green to a pale lilac. His tail swished behind him as he recognised the form standing anxiously in the open doorway. He held out large, sensitive hands.</p><p>"Beautiful," he whispered.</p><p>"Husband." The blond responded and hurried to be caught in a strong embrace before being swung around in evident joy.</p><p>The forked reptilian tongue flicked over the blond's mouth as the pink lips parted to invite a more intimate caress. A deep musical trill permeated the air indicating the pleasure of the reptilian holding the striking blond mammal. As he lowered the slender form to the floor, he felt the arousal at the blond's groin and palmed the bulge possessively.</p><p>"I have missed you, my heart," the lizard murmured, nuzzling into sweet smelling blond tresses. "Are you sure it is safe for you to be here?" he added anxiously, pulling back to gaze at the golden eyes.</p><p>"The all clear was announced an hour ago. Do you think Tristam would have allowed me to leave Silver Star to be here if unsafe, irrespective of how my soul cried for you?" the blond smiled reassuringly.</p><p>"Beloved," the lizard crooned. It was hardly surprising he hadn't been notified, but there were more important matters to attend to now. His hand caressed his mate's need.</p><p>"I desire you, Xavier," the man in his arms pleaded. "I love you."</p><p>And I love you, Theophilus," the reptilian replied. "I have a nest through here," he indicated an inner room. "Let me lock the outer door."</p><p>Xavier then ushered his slighter mate into the small room that had been his living quarters for the last four days. It contained a nest of thin, old cushions, a large chair and a small table. He heard the distressed sound from his beautiful lover. "Comfort was not a consideration," he said nuzzling and caressing. "But that matters naught now you are in my arms."</p><p>Theophilus pulled free and disrobed with what he considered indecent haste, but he longed to once again be joined with the one he loved. He quickly lay in Xavier's nest and gazed adoringly up at the dominant male.</p><p>Xavier's breath caught as the light of the dim lamp made Theophilus' skin glow with a golden hue. The slender, hairless limbs were as a siren song to the lizard. He devoured the sight of his beloved: naked, willing, open; in *his* nest. *His* mate. Xavier's trill dropped so low as to resemble a growl as he roughly removed the clothes he wore, throwing them carelessly aside. He then stood looming over the slender, supine form. He watched as arms and legs opened in silent, but unmistakable invitation.</p><p>"Please," Theophilus' melodic voice caressed Xavier's aural depressions. One single word that was both a plea and a command Xavier could not nor would not refuse. He displayed his teeth in his unique smile again as he dropped to blanket the younger man. Deceptively strong arms and legs wrapped around his shoulders and hips drawing him unresistingly closer and his tongue flicked beyond the willingly parted lips to the warm wet cavern beyond. Xavier reacquainted himself with his mate's sweetness before reluctantly withdrawing.</p><p>"I have missed you so, my husband," Theophilus panted. He pressed soft kisses to pale green, smooth skin.</p><p>"I could not chance any of my family contacting this plague," Xavier groaned. "Much less you, my beloved mate. My constitution ensured my immunity, but one I could not share with you. It has indeed been a long lonely time without your presence."</p><p>The reptilian shifted so his tongue could flicker over his mate's pink nipples, the perfect nubs pebbling instantly. Strong teeth bit down on the peaks with expert precision to ensure mounting arousal, his mate's breasts were highly sensitive and an erogenous zone for both males. He licked lower, tasting the smooth skin of abdomen and hips before the long, agile muscle wrapped around the base of his husband's smooth, slender arousal. He felt the blond buck with a sweet cry of pleasure as his tongue laved the engorged head greedily swallowing the pearly pre-come. His large hands slid under smooth toned buttocks, lifting upwards and outwards to display his mate's tiny pink portal.</p><p>Theophilus arched crying his pleasure aloud as his mate licked his opening. The reptilian tongue pressed inside his tightly furled aperture to taste the blond's natural lubricant. Theophilus knew his lover would prefer to assist dilation with the oil Xavier himself had created, and that all of their family used, but it hadn't occurred to him to bring any.</p><p>Xavier found the intimate taste combined with the pheromones his mate was producing were a potent aphrodisiac. He needed to mate, to claim that which was his and his alone.</p><p>"Love you, Beautiful," he whispered.</p><p>"Want you so much, my husband," Theophilus groaned.</p><p>The bigger male moved to lie at his young husband's side. His tongue wrapped around Theophilus' erection and began a combination of rhythmic contractions and stroking. The rough surface of the reptilian tongue provided an extra stimulation to further inflame the blond's arousal. Xavier slid his tail between spread thighs and allowed it to penetrate the writhing younger male. As it slipped inside, Xavier wound it into a corkscrew to ensure Theophilus was stretched to accept his twin penises. He made small thrusting motions with his tail, further encouraging Theophilus' natural lubricant to coat the slender channel. With expertise, Xavier timed gentle tugs to taut teats with the forked tip of his tongue laving the head of Theophilus' penis and the tip of his tail rubbing the hidden jewel deep in the blond's body.</p><p>The triple stimulation was too much for him and Theophilus' came as he cried his husband's name.</p><p>Xavier's snout covered the fragile flesh and the reptilian felt the pulses of his mate's release hit the back of his tongue. He was exceptionally careful to protect his mammalian lover from his sharp teeth. Only when Theophilus sagged spent, did Xavier release the sated organ and swallow its warm salty essence. His tail continued to pulse within Theophilus' boneless body as Xavier repositioned himself between his lover's widespread legs. He hooked slender limbs over his arms, spreading the smaller male open wide. His twin hemipenes unsheathed from inside his body, slick with lubricant as his tail withdrew from moist heat. Xavier heard his lover's moan at the sight of the glistening organs. It was a measure of Xavier's arousal that both penises had unsheathed. His young husband could accommodate both simultaneously, but would be fully filled during their love-making.</p><p>The soft mewls of pleasure from the slender male beneath him were as music to the reptilian. He slid effortlessly inside the prepared channel and began to stroke rhythmically; ensuring Theophilus' sweet spot was stimulated constantly. The lizard's tongue flicked over throat, collarbone and as far down as the peaked, pink nipples whilst his tail sinuously slid against Theophilus' sensitive hairless sac. The smaller man's hips moved in perfect harmony with his mate, his own satiated rod reawakening, trapped between their undulating bodies. Xavier knew they were both approaching their peak and his hemipenes produced their knot, completely plugging his husband's slender channel.</p><p>Theophilus groaned as he felt the stretch of his internal muscles from the forming knot. He panted shallowly as tendrils of pleasure began to bloom outwards from deep in his groin, radiating wave after wave throughout his whole body. A sharp nip to an already hypersensitive bud coinciding with his mate's hand on his primed shaft had Theophilus arching and crying Xavier's name as his essence flowed a second time between their bodies.</p><p>The contractions around his already eager organs and the combined scent and sight of his mate in sexual ecstasy finally fractured the reptilian's control. Pulse after pulse of his hot seed filled his mate, till both organs were fully spent. As he recovered from his orgasmic high, the bigger male rolled their still joined bodies to allow his lissom mate to drape voluptuously over his now sated body. The lizard sighed in absolute pleasure.</p><p>"Stay in me for a while longer," Theophilus' soft melodic voice begged.</p><p>"It would be my pleasure, my heart," Xavier replied. He gave a mental frown as he regarded the beloved visage. In his joyful reunion he had not noticed the dark smudges beneath his mate's eyes and the tiny lines around them that told of nights without sleep and the consequential headaches. He began to massage the back of his lover's head, knowing it would relax the younger man. He smiled as Theophilus' weight settled more heavily, the already satiated body relaxing further under the tender ministrations.</p><p>"Sleep in my arms, my love," Xavier crooned softly.</p><p>"Love," came as a reply on a soft breath as Theophilus sank into the first real sleep since Xavier had left the haven of Silver Star.</p><p>Xavier allowed his knot to dissipate and re-sheathed his organs. His tail wrapped around the blond male holding the smaller man close to his body, lovingly and protectively. Soon, Xavier slid into his own deep sleep.</p><p>*****</p><p>An insistent bleep awakened the reptilian. He was pleased to note it hadn't disturbed his exhausted mate. Gently he untangled their limbs and went to answer the call. He listened, replied and returned to the slowly stirring beauty in his nest. Crouching next to the supine form, Xavier shamelessly began to massage the back of Theophilus' head encouraging the smaller man to resume his sleep. He smiled as his tactic worked.</p><p>"Sleep a little longer, my love," he whispered. "When I return we can leave this inhospitable place."</p><p>"Take care," came the sleepy response.</p><p>Xavier dressed rapidly. The sooner he received the official confirmation he was no longer needed here, the sooner they could return to their ship and their family. In his haste, although Xavier closed the outer door, he failed to additionally lock it.</p><p>Theophilus became aware of being touched by hands he knew were those of strangers. With a rapid movement, he scuttled to sit clutching a sheet to his nude form. Leering at him were two men who were denizens of this world. The lascivious gazes had the blond fearing for his safety. He was unaware that in the comparative darkness neither the colour of his eyes, his slanting brows nor his small antenna were visible.</p><p>"You see, Byran," the larger of the two men hissed. "I told you the lizard had been provided with entertainment."</p><p>The speaker was large and swarthy with lank, dark hair and smelt unclean. Theophilus would have found him unattractive even if his eyes and face hadn't been filled with a mix of hate and lust.</p><p>"We have worked just as hard and for longer and have been denied such pleasures," the man continued.</p><p>Theophilus spared a glance at his companion. He was similarly swarthy, but with red hair. Although he was less physically repugnant, Theophilus still feared the lust in the hazel eyes.</p><p>"Please," the blond said quietly. "I am bonded to Xavier." He meant it to convey his status as married to the reptilian, but he could see it wasn't understood. Before he could try and explain further, a strong hand latched around his ankle to pull him closer to the two men.</p><p>"I don't care what fancy name you give it, whore," the dark man growled. "I've been cooped up here over a week with no means of relieving tension or being able to have the pleasures a body like yours can provide. I want what you gave the lizard."</p><p>Realising their intent, Theophilus made a small movement as though capitulating to his aggressors. As the men leaned eagerly forward, Theophilus lashed out with two balled fists to send both men tumbling backwards. He surged to his feet preferring not to fight naked, unarmed and outnumbered. Clutching desperately to the sheet, he flew to the outer door. He reached for the handle as a bolt of pain, that began in his spine and radiated outwards to envelop his entire body, struck him soundlessly. His body dropped instantly, twitching spasmodically. With mounting fear, the blond realised that, whilst his mind was still clear, his body was unable to respond to his frantic commands to run or fight. A terrified whimper escaped from frozen lips as booted feet came into his line of vision.</p><p>"Stupid slut," the dark man huffed. "The effects are only temporary," he added lifting Theophilus easily to drop him on the nearby lab bench. "You'll be able to enjoy us soon enough. Now let's see what we're getting."</p><p>Flicking on the lab lights, Theophilus' exotic form was clear to see. Byran caught the dark man's hand as he reached for a pale thigh. He looked with concern at the tears that leaked from golden eyes radiating fear.</p><p>Wait, Silaff," he advised. "Look at him. He's an off-worlder, too. He may not be a prostitute."</p><p>"What is he then?" Silaff asked impatiently.</p><p>"A companion, a concubine? Who knows the minds or customs of off-worlders? I have no desire to touch him. I thought we were to find one of our kind here."</p><p>"You can back off if you want," Silaff said harshly. "I'm hard. I don't care what he is. If he belongs to the lizard, so much the better. We don't need his kind here."</p><p>He reached to push Theophilus' legs apart when a roar of fury rent the air. Before Silaff could react to the sound he was pinned to the floor. A large male straddled his body. He had a mix of darker and lighter hair. Eyes that were like chips of ice bored into Silaff's. Retractable claws now dug into the fragile flesh of his throat. The male was large and powerful, strong and muscular and there was not an ounce of mercy Silaff could behold in the form. An acrid smell arose from his body as he lost bladder control and tiny whimpers of fear were all the sounds he could make as words as cold and deadly as the male that uttered them reached his ears.</p><p>"If you have defiled Theophilus I will tear out your worthless throat."</p><p>Xavier was already at his mate's side. His sensitive tongue flicked around the now shaking form as he scented the air. He could smell and taste his mate's fear, the remnants of his assailants' lust that had been superseded by their fear and the taste of their own earlier loving.</p><p>"We didn't," Byran said. He gazed at a form similar to the one pinning down Silaff. This male had sandy blond hair that reached to the shoulders and eyes that were the colour of a stormy ocean. The size and bulk of the males were almost identical. From the tilting of the blond head and the flare of the nostrils, Byran had the ridiculous notion the man was listening to his heartbeat as he was scenting him.</p><p>"I think this one speaks truthfully, Xavier," he said in a menacing voice.</p><p>"I can find no evidence of an ... assault, Tristam," the reptilian concurred. He wrapped his lab coat around Theophilus' shaking body. "The effect is already wearing off quickly, beloved," he assured softly. "You will be left unharmed."</p><p>"Uist and I can take these to the complex's supervisor," Tristam said as he watched the other powerful male effortlessly haul Silaff to his feet, claws still pricking at the man's throat.</p><p>"No, Tristam," Xavier replied. "I told Eldman repeatedly of the treatment I was subjected to and he brushed it off. I want to make a formal complaint of my treatment as well as that of my bonded mate. I would like to make it in your presence so that it is recorded into Federation annuls to be officially dealt with. Not just handled by some local officiate who will hide it or ignore it. I would be grateful if Uist could protect my mate in our absence."</p><p>Silaff was shoved roughly into Xavier's grasp and the muscular male pressed his face close.</p><p>"You will admit all, omitting nothing. If you attempt to play down in any way your vile assault I will seek retribution personally." He leant a little closer so that Silaff could feel his hot breath. "I promise you will regret it if I do." The cold hard voice left Silaff with no doubt of the big male's sincerity. He made the instant decision that prison on his homeworld was the best and the safest place to be.</p><p>Xavier quickly glanced at the other two members of his 'family'. Sholto had one arm protectively around Theophilus' shoulder, as did Rayner, helping the blond to be able to sit upright. Sholto's auburn curls were caught by the lights in the lab giving the impression of burnished metal. His ocean blue eyes were filled with concern and despite being the smallest of the group, his solid frame offered strength to the slender form he cradled. Rayner's curls were darker and his body slimmer, but the worry in his deep brown eyes matched that of Sholto's. Uist had come to stand protectively in front of the trio of younger men. Xavier knew Theophilus was as loved and safe almost as if he were to remain. He nodded at them before turning to leave with Tristam.</p><p>On returning to the lab, Xavier and Tristam stood silently contemplating the tableau before them. Uist had sat in the large chair with a dressed Theophilus in his lap. His head was tucked under Uist's chin and he was cradled by powerful arms. Sholto sat on one arm of the chair, his head on his husband's shoulder and one arm around Theophilus. Rayner was on the other. He, too, rested his head on Uist's shoulder and his arm grasped Sholto's as though they were forming a barrier to protect the slender blond. Both Tristam and Xavier scented the air. It was heavy with a familiar and heady scent and they realised that Uist had used his own musk to create an air of comfort and familiarity. The low rumbling purr the big male emitted was almost hypnotic in timbre. Xavier smiled at the efforts his family had made to comfort his mate. Neither he nor Tristam could scent any residual fear from the sleeping blond. There was only contentment and peace in the air. He saw Uist slit one eye open, but was sure the cat-man had known of their presence since they first re-entered the lab.</p><p>"Thank you, beloved brother," he said sincerely as Tristam's hand settled on his shoulder.</p><p>"Your mate is as beloved to me as Rayner," Uist said quietly. "As I am Protector of Rayner and as Tristam is Protector of Sholto, we both desire to be Protectors of Theophilus. We had hoped to make this offer before you were called away. We feel it is one that is long overdue. If you would grant us the honour?"<br/></p>

<p><b>Silver 3: The Monster Inside</b></p><p><i>Pelaam: June 2007.</i></p><p>*</p><p>The twin suns blazed their heat on the figures reclining on soft silvery sand. A cloth canopy had been set up for those whose skins were in danger of burning easily and needed the shade. A powerful male, with eyes as blue as the cloud free sky and hair the colour of both sun-baked and sea-kissed sand, smiled at the smaller form nestled at his side. Their shoulder length auburn curls were turned into myriad hues of red-gold and bronze by the suns. Even the chest hair was lit into a kaleidoscope of colour. The bigger man's eyes devoured the enticing sight of two dusky nubs that peeked shyly from their protective nest. Uist's smile was relaxed and stayed in place as he regarded the man who lay to the other side of his mate Sholto. Even relaxed as now, Tristam's powerful physique was obvious and rivalled that of Uist's own. The normally sandy blond hair had been bleached whiter and the eyes that could go from chips of ice to stormy ocean were locked on the antics of two young men that played in the warm, clear waters. Uist's eyes moved seaward.</p><p>One young man's dark curls were now plastered to his head and, even without the benefit of Tristam's enhanced vision, Uist was sure he could see the deep brown eyes glow with joy. The normally honey-tinted skin was becoming a richer hue and the lithe frame radiated health and happiness. The other young male was of a similar height and willowy build, but their waist length blond tresses, almost white from the sun's attentions, were secured in a loose plait. The very pale skin had been carefully oiled with a protective lotion and it glistened as he moved. Uist and Tristam turned simultaneously to smile at each other. The holiday was just what they had needed to relax and enjoy time together without demands from others</p><p>A sudden peal of musical laughter had their attention back to the ocean. Theophilus was now held in the arms of his husband. The powerful reptilian had swum underwater to surprise his mate. Strong, smooth, sea-green arms were around the blond's slim waist, lifting him high as he was spun around. Rayner's laughter could also be heard as Theophilus' tresses came free from their binding creating a rippling waterfall of silken strands in the sunlight. Standing still, the lizard allowed the slender male in his arms to slide down his bulkier body and flicked out his tongue to taste sun and sea, love and laughter.</p><p>Rayner decided it was time to leave the lovers as Theophilus began to nuzzle at Xavier's snout. Returning to the beach he knelt gracefully between Tristam's purposely spread thighs.</p><p>"I think Xavier needs some time alone with Theophilus," he smiled at the man he loved.</p><p>"I think he has a good idea," Tristam replied reaching to stroke a soft, smooth cheek.</p><p>"Mmm, I agree," Rayner husked leaning into the caress.</p><p>"I believe Sholto and I will take a walk into the foliage nearby," Uist purred. "It reminds me of the jungle areas of PrideHome. He picked up a towel and slung it around his shoulders. He then tenderly stroked his lover's cheeks until drowsy oceanic blue eyes met his own more intense gaze and a sleepy smile warmed the cat-man's heart. "Time for a little exercise, my own," he said softly.</p><p>"'K," Sholto murmured. He allowed himself to be pulled to his feet and tucked securely against a powerful body and nestled closer inhaling his mate's clean masculine scent.</p><p>"Take care, my brothers," Tristam said as he watched the couple meander slowly from sight.</p><p>Out in the ocean, Xavier had decided he wanted more than simple splashing in the warm waters. Watching his supple, sleek, glistening husband had aroused the reptilian. He now cradled the lithe form back-to-chest and his large, sensitive hands roamed over and caressed the smooth hairless skin of his mate's chest. He drew circles with his fingers around the small nipples teasingly until plucking gently at them to turn them into alluring, solid pink peaks.</p><p>"Husband," Theophilus whispered, his voice soft, melodic, submissive.</p><p>"Beloved," Xavier replied, seductive, silky, possessive.</p><p>Carefully he reached to divest his lover of the small swimming briefs he wore. The lizard had left his own shorts on the beach before entering the sea. A strong, knowledgeable hand began to caress the shaft that rose eagerly from golden blond curls. Then the bigger male ushered Theophilus into greater depths where they needed to tread water. Xavier's powerful thighs pressed the blond's apart. Smooth flesh teased at his hidden opening, already slick with his own natural lubricant. Xavier's tail slid sinuously inside as Theophilus arched and moaned in his bigger mate's embrace. There was little need for stretching. The blond was relaxed and lubricated and Xavier could wait no longer to be sheathed in wet heat.</p><p>The reptilian's hemipenes probed at Theophilus' entrance as Xavier's tail withdrew. The twin organs, slick with their own pre-come pressed insistently at the blond's pink rosebud and then glided effortlessly to be fully sheathed in searing tightness. Xavier felt his lover try and push back on the flesh impaling him and thrust his hips forward. Mewls and soft, sweet cries spilt from the younger male as his jewel was rubbed insistently by every ebb and flow of his mate's sexes. With a louder cry of his husband's name, Theophilus came, his seed a cloudy haze billowing into the welcoming sea.</p><p>Xavier continued to thrust as Theophilus moaned mindlessly, lost in a sensual haze of pleasure. Xavier's expert touch on his sex reawakened the sated organ, encouraging it to participate fully once again. Xavier's pleasured trilling was so low and deep as to rival Uist's purring and the younger male whimpered as he felt the vibrations throughout his sensitised body. Finally Xavier's body ceased its insistent rocking inside his mate as a prelude to his completion. He formed his knot inside Theophilus as he felt his beloved reach his pinnacle. With a muted roar of Theophilus' name, the lizard's hemipenes surrendered their seed, his release pulsing deep into the willing, lithe body.</p><p>Impaled on his husband's flesh, the warm sea cocooning them, Theophilus doubted if he would notice if they slid beneath the waves. It was a sublime feeling, being so fully filled, being unable to do nothing except accept the pleasure his mate was bestowing upon him and the blond writhed ecstatically. He felt his manhood harden again under his mate's tender ministrations. Then his lover's seed was inside him, wet heat searing him, and he felt voluptuously possessed by his husband. As he felt Xavier's release inside him, it triggered his own. Theophilous went limp, finally fully satiated and he lay trustingly in his lover's strong embrace as the reptilian's knot slowly dissipated. For long minutes they floated, enjoying post-coital intimacy in the arms of the sea.</p><p>On the beach, Tristam and Rayner had begun to kiss and caress as soon as Uist and Sholto had disappeared from sight. Two tiny scraps of cloth that had preserved modesty had quickly been discarded in favour of intimate skin-to-skin contact and the only sounds were those of love and joy. Rayner lay beneath his bigger mate as the older man slowly left open-mouthed kisses up his dark beauty's smooth thighs. He paused to nibble gently on the golden skinned delicacy.</p><p>"Ohh, Tristam," Rayner sighed.</p><p>Tristam smiled as he nuzzled closer to his young husband's need. He gazed predatorily at the column of slender rosy flesh rising from a nest of dark curls. The sunlight caught the trail of desire that had already leaked copiously and Tristam diligently lapped every trace from warm, soft skin. As he took in the red-hued head of his mate's sex he relished the low moan of pleasure. He sucked slowly and fondled the almost hairless sac, rolling and squeezing carefully the precious orbs within.</p><p>Rayner was unable to prevent the primitive sounds of pleasure that rose from him as his mate continued his erotic torture. He looked down at the bigger body kneeling between his spread thighs and opened his legs wider, offering himself to his love. He moaned as hot wet suction worked at his erection. A slick muscle tracing the sensitive underside to then lave over the prominent vein caused Rayner's slender hips to thrust instinctively. A strong arm stopped his movement and Rayner mewled as the older man began to suck in earnest.</p><p>Tristam released his prize to a low whine of distress from his beloved. The older man wanted them to come together and had felt how close his smaller lover had been. He moved to blanket their bodies. Their erections rubbed together to silent music performing a dance as old as time. As their bodies rocked gently Tristam nipped and sucked at the large dark discs of his lover's aureoles before sucking each irresistible nub in turn. Rayner's soft keening and constant writhing fractured the bigger man's control. Drenching a thick digit with oil he reached between wide-flung legs for the tiny portal hidden within the downy declivity. He inserted his fingers carefully, stretching and coating the grasping, silken walls of the slender channel.</p><p>Removing his fingers, Tristam hooked a long slim leg over his hip as he lined up his engorged shaft with the glistening entrance to his mate's body. He kissed Rayner passionately as he sank into searing tightness. Both men moaned as he came to rest, fully impaling his young lover, the tight sheath rippling its welcome for his hard flesh. They quickly found their rhythm, Rayner lifting his hips to meet every thrust of his big mate. Slow deep thrusts became faster and harder, striking Rayner's sweet spot repeatedly to leave the smaller man thrashing wildly, lost in the sexual maelstrom of his lover's making.</p><p>"I want to hear you scream my name," Tristam purred. "Want us to lose where one of us ends and the other begins. Love you, Rayner,"</p><p>"Love you," the younger man moaned softly.</p><p>The moan became a scream as Tristam fisted the dark beauty's arousal sending Rayner tumbling into completion, his seed coating his lover's hand and their sweat-slick bodies. Intense pleasure swept through the smaller body in wave after wave. Rayner was dimly aware of the low, deep groan of his name as he felt his mate's seed erupt into his body, his clenching channel milking his lover's pulsating flesh. Rayner gave a soft sigh of contentment as Tristam's weight settled over him making him feel even more loved and cherished. They traded slow sweet kisses until Tristam's softened organ finally slipped from its harbour and the older man cradled his lover to his chest.</p><p>Between his own desire to mate and the scent of growing arousal from his chosen family, Uist was achingly hard by the time he and Sholto had moved a discreet distance from the beach. The men weren't shy of nudity around each other, but all preferred to have privacy for lovemaking. He grinned as he found a soft, moss-covered knoll, with wide fern-like fronds above it for shade. He lay down the towel for added softness. They removed their swimwear; Uist then knelt and drew Sholto next to him. As they moved together, they began to kiss and caress. Slowly, Uist guided his smaller mate to lie down before he pulled back to stare possessively at the nude form of his young husband.</p><p>"I'm going to make you purr," Uist promised in a low deep rasp that seemed directly connected to Sholto's hard, leaking organ. The younger man moaned in anticipation, his body trembling with arousal.</p><p>Uist moved to part Sholto's legs widely and lay down thrusting and rotating against Sholto's groin. As he did, he plundered the warm wet cavern of Sholto's mouth, his lover sucking Uist's tongue into his own mouth to suckle. As the kiss ended, Uist growled his approval. He nipped at his mate from throat to collarbone to leave a trail of love bites. His mouth fastened over one cinnamon nub and he sucked and nipped as his fingers tugged and teased at the other to leave the younger man incoherent with need.</p><p>He hovered over the tumescent organ that lay on Sholto's furred abdomen. His tongue licked at the pool of liquid desire. He wished he could mate endlessly with his spouse. He adored the sight, sound, taste, smell and feel of making love with the responsive young man; to fill the willing body with his flesh and his seed, possessing him in the most primal of ways. With a feral grin he enveloped Sholto's shaft to the root, burying his face in the luxurious pubic pelt and inhaling musk and desire.</p><p>Sholto cried out and bucked into hot wet suction. He panted wetly as Uist let him thrust into his voracious maw; the young man's pleasure spiralling outwards from deep in his groin. He felt the rumbling purr from his bigger mate causing ripples around his sensitised shaft. Sholto arched and cried out wordlessly. His hips bucked furiously as he tumbled helplessly towards his release. Finally with a wail of Uist's name, the younger man's cream filled his husband's ravenous mouth, the older man swallowing all that was offered and sucking insistently to ensure not a drop was missed. As Sholto sagged bonelessly, Uist allowed the sated organ to slide from his lips. Sholto whimpered needily at the sight of his mate, kneeling between his legs, licking his lips with slow deliberate swipes of his tongue. His manhood twitched dryly in response to the intense look from Uist's eyes which glowed burnt umber with desire.</p><p>Uist smiled predatorily as Sholto tried to spread himself wider, silently inviting the dominant male to take him. Dark amber eyes devoured the entrance to Sholto's body that their positions now revealed to his ravenous gaze. The big man knew he would need to play his lover's body to perfection to re-arouse Sholto after such an intense orgasm. He loved to fill his young husband as much as Sholto loved to be filled and his flesh throbbed its desire to be in his mate's tight sheath. Oiling a single digit, Uist teased at the tightly furled rosette to soft mewls of encouragement. He circled the puckered flesh before pressing forward and growling softly at the moist heat enveloping his finger. As he slid as second inside, he laved at his mate's furred sac and tugged gently at the hairs on sturdy inner thighs. As a third finger entered, he licked at the filling shaft and began to stroke Sholto's prostate, causing the smaller man to buck and writhe, riding the fingers that delved deeply within his body. As Uist felt his lover push down on the questing digits and thrust up into his mouth, he knew it was time to claim that which was his. He rolled the unresisting body over and guided Sholto onto his hands and knees. He growled with gratification as his lover tried to press back onto his erect flesh. Holding the slender hips firmly, Uist pressed determinedly into the velvet channel. He continued in a controlled thrust until his sac pressed against his mate's as they were fully joined. Keeping one strong hand on Sholto's hip, Uist began to thrust as he reached under the smaller man to keep stroking the resurgent erection.</p><p>Sholto was reduced to incoherent whimpers, stimulated beyond the capacity for any sounds other than those of mind-fracturing pleasure. The large, thick organ that filled him so fully now dragged easily across his sweet spot with every thrust or rotation of his mate's powerful hips. He tried to push back and meet each of the deep thrusts with a movement of his own. He hoped he conveyed with his actions what was beyond his abilities with speech. He relished the breathy growls and purrs from the cat-man, feeling incredibly powerful that it was he that could reduce the bigger male's infamous control to dust. Sholto panted as he threw his head back and felt his lover's teeth bite at his exposed throat. He wanted to be marked and whimpered gratefully as Uist sucked hard to brand him as his.</p><p>Uist could feel how close his lover was to completion. He gave a succession of short feral jabs to Sholto's prostate causing the smaller man to howl and then gave a twist to his mate's engorged flesh. His reward was rhythmic clenching around his own aching need and an outpouring of his lover's essence over his hand. Throwing his own head back, the primal roar of completion from the older male fairly shook the ether around them. Uist blanketed his mate's back thrusting steadily even after the last of his seed had long left his slowly softening rod. As they slowly sank to the floor, Uist heard the sound he desired; part murmur, part sigh and a sound of pure contentment, Sholto's breath vibrated creating a unique purr of satiation. Uist grinned triumphantly.</p><p>Long moment passed as the lovers traded soft kisses and touches to convey the depths of the bond of love they shared. Although he regretted disturbing Sholto, Uist wanted to return to the greater safety of the rest of his family.</p><p>"We should return to our brothers," Uist said to his almost comatose mate. He swept Sholto into his arms and returned to the beach.</p><p>Uist smiled at those of his family still awake. Xavier and Tristam sat, one reading from, the other tapping into, hand held computers. Both of the other alpha males glanced up at Uist's almost silent approach and greeted him with their own smiles. Between powerful bodies lay their sleeping mates. Theophilus lay on his back, his hair casually draped over Xavier's thighs. Rayner lay curled into his side, an arm draped over the slim waist, Tristam's free hand caressing his tanned hip. Uist debated where to lay his precious bundle. He found himself looking into drowsy golden eyes. Wordlessly, Theophilus raised his free arm and with a smile of gratitude, Uist laid his lover at the blond's other side. Before moving away he stroked the satin soft cheek and received a sweet smile. As Sholto was laid down, Theophilus' arm drew him into a shared embrace. The blond's natural sweet scent quickly enticed Sholto to move closer and he mimicked Rayner's position, nestling into Theophilus' side, an arm slung possessively around his waist. Within seconds gold eyes were closed again and the soft sounds of sleeping were the only ones to be heard. Uist stretched out in front of the group, the three sleeping men kept safe between their protective and possessive partners.</p><p>****</p><p>All too soon it was time to leave the stretch of private beach and return to the sumptuous hotel. There were peals of laughter from Sholto and Rayner and more discreet amusement from Uist and Tristam when it was found that although Xavier had been able to recover his shorts from the beach, Theophilus' was now without any swimwear. Pouting adorably to many declarations of apology from his reptilian husband, the lissom blond wrapped a towel sarong-style around slender hips. Finally unable to maintain his pretended annoyance, Theophilus' musical laughter joined that of his brothers. He peppered the snout and thick lips of his lover with kisses to assure the older male he was truly not angry. However, as a punishment to Xavier as well as to Uist and Tristam for failing to show suitable concern, Theophilus declared they could dismantle their cover and carry the beach bags. With his tinkling laughter carrying in the breeze, the three more mature males did as ordered. They laughingly agreed that the look on Theophilus' face when realising his swimwear was lost at sea was well worth their 'punishment'.</p><p>Back at the hotel, Theophilus wanted to return quickly to his room to dress more suitably. As the still giggling males waited by the lifts, they were shocked when another PrideHomer emerged as the doors opened. Unlike the light and dark blond of Uist, this male's colouring was red and black, almost striped in nature and much more closely cropped. Although Uist's eyes could take on an amber colouration, but generally looked blue, the hazel of this male's eyes was such that they gave the impression of a shifting tawny kaleidoscope. The male was easily as well developed physically, a little taller and carried himself with an almost arrogant confidence. He broke into a wide smile, showing strong white teeth at three shocked miens.<br/></p>

<p><b>Chapter 4: Darkest before the Dawn</b></p><p>Pelaam: October 2007.</p><p>Xavier lay on his back, powerful legs bent and draped to the sides. He gazed upwards in naked adoration at the beautiful vision astride him. Theophilus straddled him, both of the reptilian's hemipenes buried deep inside his slick heat as the blond raised and lowered himself in a sinuous rocking motion. The long hair was unrestrained and shimmered around the slim form like a golden waterfall, rippling down the pale-skinned, slender back and over the smooth shoulders. His mate's golden eyes were closed in bliss as the younger male sought to pleasure them both. His hands gripped Xavier's thighs, using them for leverage when necessary. Xavier's large, sensitive hand reached to caress the rosy-hued rod that bobbed elegantly in time with Theophilus' movements.</p><p>"So close, my husband," he murmured. "So very, very close."</p><p>"Come for me, beloved," Xavier encouraged, forming his knot. "Let me see your ecstasy." He revelled in the sweet, wordless cries that tumbled from Theophilus' lips. The Dregan's channel was now plugged as a prelude to the lizard's own release and the blond panted softly as the twin lengths rubbed at the hidden jewel inside his body in tandem with his husband's knowing hand stroking his hardness.</p><p>"Xavier!"</p><p>The cry of his name coincided with his mate's seed pulsing in a pearlescent arc to decorate his pale green skin. Theophilus' head dropped backwards as his body trembled in the throes of a powerful orgasm. The sight of his lover was enough to trigger the reptilian's release and he relished the soft whimpers of delight from Theophilus as his hot, thick crème filled the still clenching channel. His trill was low and deep; his frill was a myriad of lilac tones indicating the level of pleasure for the lizard-man. Tenderly, he caught the willowy body as Theophilus finally slumped forward, exhausted and drained from the intense release.</p><p>"Thank you, my husband," he panted. He nestled closer to the big, broad body, his hand reaching to caress the frill to another sound of reptilian enjoyment. "I love you."</p><p>"I love you, beautiful," Xavier assured. Sleep now, beloved. Tomorrow will be a very exhausting day."</p><p>"I can hardly believe I will see some of my people from Drega," Theophilus breathed, a hint of wonder in his melodic tones. "It has been so long."</p><p>"I am sure it will be an unforgettable evening," Xavier smiled, thick lips pulling back over sharp teeth in his unique manner, unaware of how prophetic his words would prove to be.</p><p>As he lay there, cradling his lover in their nest, Xavier reminisced about their newest undertaking. They were heading to Terra II, a small, earth-like planet, but still a long way behind in technology. The complex in which Xavier and Theophilus were to be housed was huge and consisted of hotel accommodation, restaurants and bars, shopping mall, conference suites, theatre and cinema, swimming pools, gymnasium, solarium, even a small hospital, plus more, all under one huge roof. It had its own tiny spaceport. Shuttles ran to and from the complex to the orbiting space-station where off-worlders' ships docked. It was the most prestigious complex the world could offer and yet in some ways was very basic compared to other places the couple had experienced. They were accompanying their 'papa', Jameson, who was the facilitator for a trade negotiation between Drega and Terra II. Xavier knew his husband was both excited and nervous about meeting some of his own people. Even so many years after their union, it was still rare for Dregans to leave their home-world.</p><p>Remembering how he and Theophilus met soon had the reptilian's thoughts turning to his husband's father. Marcellous' reluctant acceptance of his suit and the way his beloved blond had been treated not just then, but as a child, coming into Xavier's mind. His frill became vermillion as the lizard's anger began to seep out.</p><p>A pale hand reached to caress his frill and Theophilus moved restlessly as if aware of his mate's change of mood. Xavier immediately ran his tongue over the pale expanse of Theophilus' throat in a feather-light caress and crooned softly. The actions both de-railed his anger and settled his husband. Theophilus was much attuned to him after their years together. He nuzzled at the gold silk of his beloved's hair, inhaling Theophilus' sweet scent and his heart soared at the soft sigh of pleasure from the still sleeping form. Although he saw no reason to be concerned about the trade conference, Xavier was still glad that the rest of their family would be arriving after them, within a day or so. They had been missed by both his mate and himself. He tightened his grip on the slender body and allowed Theophilus' rhythmic breathing to lull him to sleep.</p><p>****</p><p>Theophilus gazed with awe at the banqueting hall-cum-ballroom. It had been sumptuously decorated in white and gold. Those attending the gala evening had to dress in one or a mixture of the colours. Theophilus wore white leggings and a thin gauzy tunic with a golden edge. His blond hair, unusual for Dregans, shone as though made of burnished gold and had attracted many admiring comments, much to the shy male's embarrassment. But he had smiled and accepted the compliments and had felt Xavier's pride at the way he handled himself as much as from the admiration.</p><p>Xavier's outfit was simple white pants with a gold waistcoat which did nothing to hide the bulk and innate power of the large reptilian. Now he had been caught in conversation by some Terra II medics and Theophilus had wandered away a little, caught up in the magic of the evening. He had even spoken to a couple of dark-haired denizens of Drega. He was aware there was some disagreement within the Dregan delegation, but didn't understand the mechanics of it. Whilst he may have been born on Drega, Earth, Phixia and PrideHome were his home worlds now. He ambled towards the open French windows and stared out into the manicured gardens. White and yellow lights twinkled giving it an ethereal appearance and Theophilus took another step, entranced by the beauty.</p><p>Two large males moved silently behind him, scooping him under his arms to bundle him forwards. Theophilus was peripherally aware they were Dregan, but the speed and shock of the attack caught him so much by surprise, he didn't have time to cry out. He was pinned to an outside wall and as he recovered his stunned wits, he recognised the hard, scarred visage before him.</p><p>"Father," he whispered.</p><p>"Hardly the way to greet me after so many years apart, Theophilus," the silver-haired male smiled malevolently. "I think this more appropriate."</p><p>He covered the blond's lips with his own, thrusting a tongue past Theophilus' teeth as his knee pushed between the younger male's slender thighs. Marcellous kept Theophilus' hands pinned above his head as he plundered the unwilling mouth, knowing that the blond's upbringing would make it impossible for him to try and physically resist the man who was his father. In the past, all children on Drega had been trained from infancy to obey their sires unquestioningly. The society had been a brutal, unbending patriarchal system. More recently this practice had been outlawed, but in Marcellous' time, he had brought up all his sons in this manner; especially his youngest child for whom he'd had such special plans.</p><p>For a second or two, Theophilus' childhood training made him pliant in his father's hold, then, to Marcellous' surprise, he began to fight to free himself. The kiss was broken as silver and gold struggled, then Theophilus felt himself pushed backwards as he managed to pull free and another male stood between him and his father.</p><p>"Get your filthy hands off my son, you bastard" Jameson growled menacingly. He was vibrating with barely controlled fury. He'd seen Theophilus apparently ushered outside and something had niggled about the action. Now he gave silent thanks for his impeccable instincts.</p><p>"*Your* son?" Marcellous spat incredulously. "A mere *human*? He. Is. *Mine*."</p><p>Marcellous spoke each word with such venom it had Theophilus terrified. He reached to Jameson, trying either to pull him away from the advancing Dregan or to interpose his own body between them. His golden eyes locked with the cold silver orbs of the vastly older male as Marcellous advanced towards them.</p><p>"You turned your back on him, renouncing him as your son when he chose to marry Xavier. I welcomed him freely into my home and am proud to call him my son," Jameson continued, resisting Theophilus' persistent tugging. The mature human had no intention of letting the depraved bastard before him touch his beloved blond again.</p><p>"You are part of a human family?" Marcellous sneered.</p><p>"Jameson has been more of a father to me in the years I have known him that you were in all the years that preceded. I love him and I am proud to call him Papa." Theophilus said sincerely. He was hoping to divert attention from Jameson to himself and found his strategy working too well. Chilling silver eyes sent shivers down his spine.</p><p>"Then perhaps I should remind you just who your real father is, boy," Marcellous snarled. The big Dregan's power and speed took even Theophilus by surprise as the blond had never challenged one of his own kind before. Jameson was effortlessly pushed aside with one hand as the other brutally backhanded the smaller Dregan, sending him spinning to the ground, too stunned to be able to protect himself as Marcellous continued to stalk forward. Theophilus looked up dazed only to see his father jerked backwards to be slammed against the same wall he had been pinned against.</p><p>"Touch any of my family again and I will kill you." Xavier stood, his frill a shade of red that Theophilus had never seen before, tail lashing furiously from side-to-side and his normally placid expression changed out of all recognition. The reptilian's whole demeanour was one of unadulterated rage.</p><p>Jameson had already regained his feet and glanced with concern at the blond whose body was beginning to shake from the shock of all that had happened. He wanted Theophilus away from here.</p><p>"Marcellous is not a recognised name on the delegate list, Xavier," he said, glaring at the male who now stood with the other Dregan. "I will ensure he is deported immediately from Terra II." He lowered his voice. "Your husband needs you," he added.</p><p>Xavier's attention swiftly moved to his lover who was still on the ground. With a muted sound of grief, Xavier reached to scoop Theophilus into his arms. He crooned softly as his mate buried his head into a powerful shoulder.</p><p>"Take me away from here, husband," he pleaded, his voice a bare whisper. "Please take me away."</p><p>Xavier threw a desperate look at Jameson who nodded curtly.</p><p>"Take him where he feels safe, Xavier. I'll deal with this and call to see you're both alright later."</p><p>Xavier strode to their room, ignoring looks and whispers as they passed. He regretted they had to move through the ballroom. A couple of the Dregans his beloved had spoken to looked shocked, but Xavier was uncaring of others, just the precious bundle in his arms. He was grateful to see security guards heading towards Jameson and presumed the more mature human male had used a personal security device to alert them to his need. Xavier locked their door and curled protectively around his lover in their nest until the silent tears were spent. Golden eyes, heavy with soul-deep sadness, gazed anxiously into his own orbs.</p><p>"Do you still love me?" Theophilus asked tremulously.</p><p>"Of course I do, my beloved," Xavier vowed.</p><p>"He kissed me, touched me," Theophilus whispered. "My body is now only to be so touched by the man I love. I failed to stop him..."</p><p>"Shh, my love," Xavier crooned, not wanting his husband to blame himself for the unprovoked attack by Marcellous. "He tried to take that which belongs only to me. *He* failed. For which I am forever grateful. You are my husband, my beloved mate. No matter what might have happened, I would still love you. I will always love you. Let me show you."</p><p>Theophilus was unresisting as Xavier tenderly stripped his still shivering form. He allowed his husband to lay him flat, the bigger male looming dominantly over him. A forked tongue began to lick at him along his throat as a sinuous tail stroked the satin skin of his inner thighs. Without conscious thought, he spread himself open, lying submissively, vulnerably, before the man he adored. Large, strong hands caressed his chest, tugging at his small pink nipples and fondling his lax rod and hairless sac. The combination of different touches over so much of his body soon had the younger male lost in a maelstrom of sensation. Slowly his shaft rose, his channel began to produce its lubricant, dilating slowly, ready for penetration and he moaned mindlessly as Xavier's tail slid inside to caress his hidden sweetness. He cried wordlessly as a single hemipenis replaced Xavier's tail inside his body. Instead the agile appendage spiralled around his throbbing erection to begin rhythmic contractions. He felt his lover's knot stretch his sheath and then hot juices were filling him, triggering his own release.</p><p>"I love you," he heard Xavier vow. "I will always love you."</p><p>"Never let me go," he pleaded. "I love you so much."</p><p>"Never," Xavier promised. "No one will ever take you away from me. Rest, my precious, sleep safe in my arms. Our family will arrive tomorrow and we all love you."</p><p>As Theophilus lay sleeping fitfully, Xavier hugged him tightly. He only released the traumatised blond long enough to reassure an anxious Jameson that Theophilus was not unduly harmed physically. As yet, he was unsure of the mental damage the assault may have caused. He cradled the younger man long into the night, crooning and stroking when Theophilus seemed to be becoming more restless. If he had thought he had hated Marcellous before, it was nothing compared to the loathing that now coursed through reptilian veins.</p><p>****</p><p>Tristam, Rayner, Uist and Sholto listened to Jameson with a mixture of shock, horror and fury as he recounted what had befallen their much-loved brothers. Jameson had both entered a formal charge against Marcellous and pointed out he had no right to be on the planet in the first place. The Terra II liaison officer assigned to him, one to whom Jameson had taken an instant dislike, had responded and had Marcellous put under house arrest until a ship could be readied to deport him.</p><p>"Marcellous' life is forfeit should he and I cross paths," Uist growled, his claws unsheathing and re-sheathing. "I intend to request recognition of PrideHome blood feud."</p><p>"Uist, wait," Jameson said, holding up a restraining hand. "As much as I detest Marcellous, I would not want to do anything to further distress Theophilus. Be very certain of what he wants and what he needs. Marcellous is still his father and at present Theophilus is afraid, shocked and worried about how you will react to him. To him, not Marcellous," he emphasised.</p><p>"But why?" Rayner asked. "He did nothing wrong."</p><p>"Theophilus was raised knowing he was a commodity to be sold and to obey his father unquestioningly. It took many years for Xavier to make him understand theirs was a partnership of equals. As much as he adores his husband, and they were clearly made for each other, it can still be hard for him to ask for what he wants and needs. He blames himself for the assault, for not reacting quicker or more strongly, and preventing what transpired. His initial fear was losing Xavier's love, his second losing ours. Although he will be unable to ask for it, what he needs now is for us to show him just how much we love him."</p><p>"I will be guided by you this time, Papa," Uist conceded reluctantly. He pulled Sholto close to his side. The possessive gesture spoke eloquently of the cat-man's inner turmoil. "But if Marcellous ever tries again to harm any of my family, as you are my witnesses, I will evoke blood feud. He will find no safe refuge in this universe from me or mine."</p><p>****</p><p>It was an unnaturally quiet and subdued group that headed to the quarters assigned to Xavier and Theophilus. Normally there would be teasing banter and laughter. Five hearts clenched as they caught their first sight of their blond brother. The normally confident male was huddled close to his mate, his face expressing fear, doubt, misery and worry. For Rayner it was too much to bear. With a muted cry he ran from the rest of the group, aware that Sholto was just a step behind. Both wrapped their arms around Theophilus almost simultaneously.</p><p>"We love you, Theophilus," Rayner assured, knowing he spoke for all. He kissed a cool, too-pale cheek.</p><p>"All of us," Sholto added, kissing the other. Both were relieved when Theophilus' arms reached to encircle them and hold them tightly.</p><p>"I love you all so much," Theophilus said, his voice thick with emotion. "I feared I had forfeited your love for me."</p><p>"Never," both Rayner and Sholto spoke. "No matter what happens, Theophilus, remember we will always love you." The two humans stepped back as the rest of the group now moved to join them and Uist came forward. They watched as Theophilus' head dropped submissively, unwilling to meet the intense blue gaze of the PrideHomer.</p><p>Gently, but persistently, Uist used a single finger to tip Theophilus' chin upwards until their eyes could meet.</p><p>"I love you, beautiful," he said softly. He wrapped his arms around the lithe form as Theophilus almost collapsed against him. He kissed the smooth forehead and nuzzled him affectionately. He could still scent fear and anxiety, but it was receding. Slowly.</p><p>"I love you, my Protector," Theophilus whispered, using Uist's title.</p><p>Giving one last squeeze, Uist released Theophilus for Tristam to come forward; the leader of their team, husband of Rayner, chosen brother of all and Protector of Theophilus and Sholto.</p><p>"Theophilus," he said softly. "No matter where you are, or whatever may befall you, remember you are family. We will stand by you, for you, search endlessly if you are lost to us and love you unconditionally." He accepted the armfuls of sobbing blond as the last of Theophilus' fears gave way to cleansing tears. One by one, the rest of the group moved to join the embracing couple.</p><p>Like a silent sentinel above them, the complex security camera caught and recorded everything said and done until they finally broke apart. A residual sadness still remained, but it was clear from the brighter, less haunted look in Theophilus' eyes that his family had found exactly the right things to say to reassure him.</p><p>****</p><p>That day and the next passed without incident. Theophilus was becoming more his normal self, laughing and playing with his family. The only outward sign of any insecurity was the need for more contact from his mate. The reptilian was more than happy to provide kisses and caresses as necessary, pleased to see his lover less inhibited. The group were happy to find that Jameson was free to join them for an evening meal although they could see the older human was frustrated by the lack of progress.</p><p>"I begin to wonder why Drega elected Telleran to be lead delegate with power of veto. It seems his notion about how the treaty should be worded is out of step with both the rest of his own people and Terra II. It's not only frustrating everyone, but he's making enemies of all by his attitude. He's conceding things slowly, but at this rate it's going to take a week or more to conclude what should be arranged in just a couple of days."</p><p>"Telleran's family are one of the largest on Drega," Theophilus supplied. "They are quite powerful and influential."</p><p>"Perhaps he's just like many of the old-school, patriarchal Dregans who think they should simply speak and be obeyed?" Sholto offered.<br/></p>

<p><b>Chapter 5: Son and Lover</b></p><p><i>Pelaam©: October 2007.</i></p><p>Tristam had avoided any cases for just over six weeks. They had all suffered, leaving them both mentally and physically drained, from the events on Terra II. As the team's commanding officer, as well as their being his family, he knew they needed to relax fully. He especially needed to know Theophilus was capable of resuming his place, and full participation, before a new mission was accepted. Things had been particularly hard on the blond. However Tristam, and the others, had been pleased and proud at the way the young Dregan had recovered.</p><p>He had watched as the haunted look in expressive golden eyes had slowly been replaced by his normal confidence. He and Uist, in particular, had spent a great deal of time both together and individually with Theophilus, assuring him of their love for him and his unwavering place in their lives. Rayner and Sholto had ensured that the three of them had plenty of relaxing times as well as fun, not letting Theophilus duck out of anything they had planned. Throughout it all, Xavier had stood back, allowing his extended family help heal his mate, letting Tristam know how much he was grateful for their united care.</p><p>To some degree, Tristam now felt he no longer had any choice. Jameson had contacted them to say they had some strong, reliable information on a slaver the Elite had long wanted to catch: The Sheik. So named because he wore long, flowing robes and a turban wrapped around his head and face to preserve his anonymity. The thought of young, helpless men and women snatched from their homes and family to be slaves, of one kind or another, had Tristam particularly distressed. He desperately wanted his to be the Lead Team.</p><p>Although to some degree breaking a slaving ring was a 'fire-fighting' exercise, the more they broke the more lives they saved, even if the trade didn't cease. He knew Theophilus had a strongly compassionate nature and would not be approaching the blond if he had not already spoken to Xavier, both as husband and physician, and been assured that Theophilus was ready to work again. Taking the young Dregan to one side, he had not even finished his talk before Theophilus was almost begging for them to take on the mission and for him to be allowed to participate. He had been so proud of the less mature male's attitude and commitment. They had hugged tightly before he had sent Theophilus to Xavier and he had contacted Jameson. Now they were heading to rendezvous with the older man.</p><p>****</p><p>In their quarters, Tristam laid side-by-side with his beloved husband. Their hands traced random patterns on each other's skin and they smiled gently. Rayner pushed his bigger mate onto his back and kissed him thoroughly, straddling over the broad, golden-tanned body.</p><p>"Thank you," he murmured, nuzzling at Tristam's throat. "For making Theophilus so happy."</p><p>"What did I do?" Tristam asked, his voice a deep, sinful rasp. "I want to make sure to do it again if this is my reward."</p><p>Rayner laughed softly, his tongue then meandering down his husband's throat to his chest where he finally sucked contentedly on a dark pink nub.</p><p>"Although he is much improved, knowing you wanted him to participate in this case, to still be a part of the team, meant so much to him." Rayner said. He felt the discontent even as it began in the older man's mind. "Hush, love," he admonished, nipping at the succulent nubbin to a small gasp. "You know it is a part of his heritage. Sholto has spent a lot of time teaching Theophilus some of his world's more modern history and customs. He had never revisited Drega, even through computer, from the day Xavier took him as his mate. He understands, intellectually, his world has moved on. But he still finds himself tied by what he was brought up to think and accept. The change is happening, both for the planet and for Theophilus, slowly. This is the start. When you think about it, he never expected to have to face anything to do with Drega again when Marcellous effectively cast him aside."</p><p>Tristam nodded slowly. That was something he had not considered. He could now understand some of Theophilus' feelings. The blond Dregan had subconsciously held onto a measure of his origins when faced with an unknown universe, whereas he himself had no idea of his own. Whoever had taken him and made him into a hybrid of human and PrideHomer was also unknown, as were their ultimate intentions towards him; although a human who could see, hear and smell as well as the cat-race had obvious advantages in certain situations. But he had only come to be able to control his abilities with the care and compassion shown by Jameson and Aurora. When first in their home, they had spent untold numbers of days retreating to a room where it could be light, sound and smell free. His mastery of his senses came from love, devotion and determination. He doubted whether if he had remained a prisoner, he would be sane or even alive.</p><p>"Hey," Rayner murmured softly, effectively breaking into the older man's thoughts.</p><p>"I love you, angel," Tristam said. "You are so very, very special." He rolled their bodies and began to caress his lover's soft, honey-tinted skin. Mouth and tongue began to follow the trail of his hands until his face was buried in the dark nest of curls that adorned a smooth, erect penis. Tristam rumbled his approval as Rayner spread his legs wide and the bigger male licked around Rayner's sac and shaft. He could taste and scent his mate's musk and arousal. Tendrils of pleasure from his lover's mind slipped into his own, increasing their mutual stimulation.</p><p>"Feels good," Rayner whispered, his hands caressing Tristam's head and shoulders. "Oh, that's nice," he gasped as his husband's talented tongue swirled around the reddened head of his shaft. His hips moved in desultory thrusts and he enjoyed the feeling of his lover's warm, wet mouth around his erection. "Make love with me," he murmured.</p><p>"Always," Tristam vowed, reaching for the oil they used. Kneeling between Rayner's splayed thighs; the big male thoroughly coated his fingers. He leant down to kiss his beautiful love as he probed delicately between smooth nether cheeks. He caressed the tightly furled rosette that granted him entry to his mate's body before reaching inside the hot, tight channel. They let their shared pleasure ebb and flow between their minds as Tristam tenderly prepared Rayner's body amongst adoring kisses and words of love and devotion. As he stroked his fingers across his mate's jewel, it was almost as electrifying as having his own touched as Rayner shared the mental delight with him. All too quickly, however, their bodies demanded more.</p><p>Rayner embraced his husband as the bigger man positioned his sex against Rayner's prepared portal.</p><p>"Make us one, Tristam," he begged. His moan of pleasure was echoed by his mate's as two bodies united. Slowly everything else slipped away, all that existed was tight heat and the flow of joy between them as the lovers sought to be as one physically, mentally and spiritually. Their bodies moved in a silent harmony, dancing to music as old as time that only they could hear. Soft sounds of need and pleasure added to the melody. Their hips undulated in synchronised movements, driving them both to a shattering crescendo and the outpouring of their combined seed. Rayner coated their bodies and Tristam filled his husband with his release, each man vocalising shared joy. For long moments they lay together, content to simply bask in their orgasmic afterglow.</p><p>"I love you, Tristam," Rayner said quietly, his voice laced with satiated pleasure.</p><p>"I love you," Tristam replied instantly. He manoeuvred their bodies to lie facing his beloved. He kissed reddened, swollen lips. "I don't like this mission. Even though I know I want to do it," the older man confessed. "You, Sholto and Theophilus are all young and beautiful enough to catch the eye of this man and you will be where he can reach you."</p><p>"And we will be watched over by you, Uist and Xavier. You can be with us in moments if anything happened we couldn't control."</p><p>"I just don't like deliberately putting any of you in jeopardy. I never have and never will."</p><p>"Any of us could refuse and, in case you've forgotten, it was our idea to make ourselves prominent in the hopes we *do* catch his attention. I trust you. I trust all of you. Anyway, all we'll be doing initially is gathering data and allowing ourselves to be seen in what we believe to be his most usual haunts. How dangerous can that be?"</p><p>"Dangerous enough," Tristam growled, gathering the lithe form close. Something was making him feel very protective. Putting it down to concern for his mate's and chosen brothers' safety, Tristam settled them both snugly. As Rayner slept, he mounted vigil.</p><p>****</p><p>In another part of the ship, Uist was feeling the same level of inexplicable protectiveness. He had barely let Sholto further than arm's reach since Tristam had confirmed they had accepted the mission. Additionally, he had felt it necessary to check out those to whom he was Protector. Rayner and Theophilus had been happy to accept his need as simply part of his nature and he had been grateful for their forbearance.</p><p>He nipped gently at the creamy, fur-dusted mounds that were before his avaricious eyes. His lover was on his hands and knees, his head pillowed on his arms. The cat-man's tongue slid slowly down the exposed cleft once more, teasing the younger human and he growled approvingly as Sholto pushed back, silently demanding more. Their combined scent of arousal and desire was a potent aphrodisiac and this time Uist's tongue thrust greedily inside his mate to taste further.</p><p>Sholto moaned his appreciation as he felt the thick, slick, agile muscle push inside him. His lover's protectiveness had resulted in a day of touches and caresses that had kept the young man's arousal simmering. As tempting as it had been to haul Uist into their den and love him senseless earlier, Sholto knew if he let nature take its course, waiting until Uist was at the edge of his control, it would be even better. Already his mate's tongue had mapped out every inch of his body, leaving not a millimetre that unlicked. The undivided, erotic attention had driven Sholto to his first climax. He was again hard, dripping and eager, but Uist was still wetting him, stretching him, using his sinfully talented tongue to drive Sholto to the edge of the precipice over and over. It was amatory torture and Sholto loved it, loved Uist, and loved the way his big mate could play his body to perfection.</p><p>"More, please, love," he whimpered, pushing back. "Oh, yeah, gooood," Sholto gave a guttural groan as thick, oil-drenched fingers replaced his mate's tongue. They swept over his jewel repeatedly until the young man was almost incoherent with need and his pleas were unintelligible except on a primal level.</p><p>Satisfied with his effect on his adored husband, Uist lined up his slickened sex against the entrancing entrance and finally pushed inside the tight channel. For a moment he let both of them relish the feeling of being as one and then began to thrust in long, slow, deep movements, each one dragging over his mate's sweet spot until Sholto was shaking with need. Uist watched his shaft slide in and out of his lover before pulling the smaller body to sit astride his strongly muscled thighs. In this position all the control was his. He used powerful haunches to drive himself into Sholto's body, holding tight to the smaller man with one hand and pumping the rock-hard rod between his mate's legs with the other. His kissed and nipped at the fragile throat, bared for his ministrations. He could feel and scent how close his lover was.</p><p>"Come for me, mine," he rasped in Sholto's ear, his voice low and thick with arousal.</p><p>The sound, as much as the words, was enough for the younger male. Stars danced before Sholto's eyes and his body shook with the ferocity of his release, his seed fountaining over the bed. He felt his body clamp brutally around the flesh impaling him and he moaned wantonly as hot, wet juices filled him. He felt thoroughly debauched and totally sated. His limbs were leaden and he simply let his husband position him as the cat-man desired.</p><p>"That's nice," he mumbled, as his mate's sinful tongue rasped over his body, licking him clean. Then he was tucked securely up against Uist's large, strong body.</p><p>"I love you, mine," Uist rumbled.</p><p>"I love you, too," Sholto replied, nuzzling against Uist's shoulder.</p><p>"Sleep safe," Uist whispered, as he felt Sholto slip into slumber. As he kissed his mate's temple, apprehension tickled at the periphery of his awareness. Those he loved were purposely undertaking dangerous work and he had to permit it. His grip tightened around the lithe form. He vowed to be especially vigilant.</p><p>****</p><p>In the ship's pool, Theophilus and Xavier were enjoying relaxing in the water. Theophilus had felt a little off-colour and, given the upcoming case, neither male were unduly surprised. The idea to play in the pool was Xavier's and Theophilus was grateful to his husband and feeling himself once more. He laughed joyously as his mate's tail snaked between his spread thighs as he trod water and tickled at his perineum. Strong arms enveloped him and he was carried, laughing and kissing Xavier, into shallower water. Theophilus murmured his pleasure as his mate's tail slipped between his cheeks to thrust gently into his rapidly dilating body.</p><p>"You are easily aroused today, my heart," Xavier whispered, before his tongue slid in and out of the blond's willing mouth.</p><p>"I love you so much, my husband," Theophilus replied. "It seems I just cannot get enough of you and your touches. I am ... apprehensive ... about this mission. I do not want to let any of you down perhaps that is why I feel I need you so much."</p><p>"Put it from your mind and let me love you, my sweet. We can talk in our nest," Xavier crooned.</p><p>"Yes, oh yes, yes," Theophilus' words became a chant as Xavier's tail was replaced by his twin sexes. Theophilus knew how close he was and unsurprised his lover formed his knot instantly. Xavier's tail wound around his aching erection and within three rhythmic contractions his climax erupted. He heard Xavier's trill of completion as he cried his husband's name and he felt the reptilian's seed flood his still spasming channel. He slumped replete in strong, loving arms.</p><p>"So tired," he murmured. He often felt drained after they made love but, at that moment, he felt incapable of keeping his eyes open.</p><p>"You are worrying about the mission too much," Xavier whispered. "Let your body tell you what you need. Do not push yourself too hard. I will carry you to our nest and when you wake we will talk." The lizard gave his unique smile as Theophilus' head snuggled into his shoulder and a soft, unintelligible murmur was his only reply. Xavier hoped his mate did not worry himself into exhaustion.</p><p>****</p><p>From their meeting with Jameson, the six returned to 'Silver' with chips, tapes and even some paper records all with information on, or believed to concern, the slaver they sought. Whilst Tristam, Uist and Xavier remained on the main deck, piloting the ship and discussing the ways they could best help protect their mates, Sholto, Rayner and Theophilus were closeted away, making themselves familiar with every piece of data. With their nemesis preserving anonymity, they could not always be certain the reports concerned the same man. Sholto offered the thought that there could be more than one as some of the information seemed too old to relate to the same individual.</p><p>"I will return quickly, my brothers," Theophilus excused himself, smiling reassuringly as Sholto and Rayner looked up. He quickly headed for the ship's medical centre, knowing his mate was on the command deck. It was distasteful to him to be secretive towards his husband or his family. However, he had not felt himself for a couple of weeks. He was certain he was not ill, but perhaps still feeling some lingering effect from the time at Terra II. He desperately needed to undertake this mission and did not want the overly protective, more mature males, leaving him out. He ran a simple blood test; not wanting to do anything that Xavier could find and question him about.</p><p>He stared at the result and quickly ran a second. The result did not change. //It cannot be// he thought to himself, but he knew the results did not lie. He buried his face in his hands for a moment and then stood up straight. He could manage this. It had already been decided that if they had no success within a week, they would need to withdraw and begin again. //A week is no time at all. I can wait that long. I shall wait that long.// He shut down the computer terminal, but in his stunned state failed to stop the machine automatically saving the results. He selected some medicinal herbs that would help fortify his system and then returned to Sholto and Rayner.</p><p>"These are the space station bars that our man seems to prefer," Sholto said as Theophilus joined them once more. "There are three of them. We thought we could work in pairs," he explained. "You and me, Rayner and me and you and Rayner. Does that seem fair?"</p><p>"I am quite happy," Theophilus nodded. He smiled at the two humans so beloved to him. He was making the right decision. A week would make no difference.</p><p>****</p><p>It was the end of a tiring and distasteful day. Three protective males sat at the poolside as their mates swam and splashed, both cleansing and comforting themselves following the day's events. Once the three young men were dry and dressed once more, they convened a meeting with the Leader of the Elite they would be working closest with.</p><p>Darius was pleased to find he was as welcomed by the attractive Dregan and his hovering reptilian mate as by the others of Tristam's team. He had held some lingering concerns that either Theophilus or Xavier may not have been happy to work alongside the man who had put the blond into custody when accused of murder, however, Theophilus had treated him affectionately and warmly.</p><p>"How did you fare, guys?" he asked as they sat around the circular table. At the looks that passed between them, Darius guessed it had not been pleasant.</p><p>"We spoke privately to the bar owners. Only one owns and runs his bar, the others employ managers to do the work," Rayner said. "The two run by managers were by far the ... seedier." He gave a shudder and Tristam and Uist growled at the implied memory. Rayner gave them a wry smile.</p><p>"One of the owners, despite seeing both mine and Theophilus' Elite Security ID chips, actually asked me if I was interested in 'selling' Theophilus," Sholto said. This time three males gave the impression of growling, Xavier's frill becoming redder and his trill low and menacing. "A young Dregan is almost unheard of out here and, of course, Theophilus is exceptionally beautiful." Sholto grinned at his brother, who stared at him with wide eyes.</p><p>"Sholto, please," Theophilus murmured, a crimson blush stealing over his face.</p><p>"My mate speaks true," Uist rumbled. "We each have a beautiful husband and we regularly experience avarice and deal with it. However, this goes beyond normal jealousies."</p><p>"The one who owns and runs his bar seemed helpful." Theophilus spoke, his colour slowly returning to normal. "He wishes to keep a 'clean bar' as he put it. He is happy for us to sit and watch for the Sheik. He was even willing to point out the man if we missed him. With the other two, I think it would be advisable to have undercover Elite stake them out. I do not think we would be supported, or particularly safe, in their establishments."</p><p>"I think our other teams could also find it profitable to enquire into the background of someone as foolish as to proposition Sholto so brazenly," Xavier said, the lizard's anger making his voice brittle.<br/></p>

<p><b>6: Mirrored Image</b></p><p><i>Pelaam(c): January 2008.</i></p><p>Aboard 'Silver Star' the three couples were making their farewells. Their new mission meant that the team had to separate; something they rarely did. As Theophilus, Sholto and Rayner were all now pregnant the air was highly emotionally charged.</p><p>Sholto was just over a couple of months into his pregnancy, but already he suffered easily from pregnancy sickness, at any time of day. As consequence of which Uist was highly protective of, and exceptionally careful with, his young mate. Anticipating the need for a prolonged farewell with his husband, Sholto had already taken an anti-emetic especially created for him by Xavier. It meant he was now able to remain on their bed on his hands and knees, legs spread wide as Uist's tongue bathed his body. He groaned softly as his auburn hair was wrapped around a strong hand to bare the nape of his neck. Sharp teeth bit gently before a rasping tongue licked over the exposed surface. It moved across his shoulders, swept across his back and laved creamy, fur-dusted globes. This time Sholto's moan was deeper, more wanton.</p><p>"More, please," he pleaded, pushing back to try and impale himself on the slick, agile muscle that teased so enticingly. He gave a soft cry as the circling tongue began to push inside his body. He groaned his frustration as the welcome invader was withdrawn.</p><p>"Gently, mine," Uist purred, rubbing circles over Sholto's back. He oiled two fingers and slid them into his mate's molten heat, relishing the moan and the pungent scent of musk and arousal. His own shaft was almost purple-headed with its need, liquid desire pooling on the bed as he carefully excited and prepared his lover. He knew he needed to take care of his husband in more ways than one. The hard, fast loving he would normally favour if parting from the young human was now not possible. Sholto was having a hard time carrying their child and the cat-man would do nothing to jeopardise either precious life.</p><p>"Want you so much," Sholto murmured, pushing back against the delving digits. "Love you so much."</p><p>"I love you, too, Sholto," Uist rasped, as he eased a third finger alongside the others still stretching and slicking the tight channel. Slowly, tenderly, the big male eased Sholto backward, sliding his hardness into the prepared sheath to soft whimpers of his name. He then manoeuvred Sholto astride his thighs where the smaller man was only able to accept being loved at Uist's pace.</p><p>Sholto groaned his appreciation as he finally sat flush on hard, furred thighs. He let his head fall back onto a broad shoulder, letting Uist control everything. He murmured wordless encouragements as Uist's body undulated gently, massaging his sweet spot. One of his husband's hands rolled one nipple then its twin whilst the other stroked him in concert with the rubbing against his prostate. Sholto's head rolled from side-to-side as he reached back to hold Uist's shoulders. He was hovering on the brink of orgasm and whimpered his need.</p><p>"Come for me," a dark, seductive, possessive voice husked into his ear and he was powerless to do anything but obey.</p><p>He cried Uist's name as his seed arced from his body. He felt his channel clamp on the hard flesh impaling him as Uist's roar heralded the rush of his mate's essence pulsing inside him. He felt his husband's teeth fasten on his shoulder accompanied by a hard sucking and knew he was being marked.</p><p>He was laid down carefully on the bed and Uist's gentle, thorough tongue rasped once more over his body. He was then cradled to the cat-man's powerful chest and nestled closely. He knew that during the mission Uist would be working with Xavier, whilst Tristam would be in more danger as he would be alone, but he still fretted about his mate's safety. His altering hormones made him emotionally vulnerable. He wrapped his arm across Uist. Lovemaking tired him as quickly as it did Theophilus and he felt himself losing the battle to keep his eyes open.</p><p>"Sleep a while, my love," he dimly heard Uist's soft purr.</p><p>Uist stroked his mate's auburn hair as Sholto slept. As a PrideHomer it went against all of his instincts to leave his pregnant mate, but this was a critical mission. Only a tiny number within the Elite even knew of its existence. He knew the younger men would all be taken care of by Jameson and Aurora; spoilt, in fact. However, he still disliked leaving any of them. He pressed a kiss to Sholto's temple. The sooner it began, the sooner it would be over.</p><p>****</p><p>Tristam was as equally caring of his newly pregnant young husband. They had only just been given permission by Xavier to make love and Tristam was taking no chances with Rayner's comfort. The younger man was on his side, Tristam spooned up tightly behind him. The bigger man's fingers tenderly prepared his lover as he sucked on Rayner's earlobe eliciting appreciative shivers of arousal from the lithe brunette.</p><p>Rayner writhed as his manhood hardened at Tristam's slow, soft touches. Mental pleasure ebbed and flowed between them until Rayner was uncertain whether he felt his own happiness or Tristam's. He could feel his lover's flesh as a hard, hot brand against his nether cheeks as Tristam's fingers worked their magic to ready him to accept his husband's sex. One of his hands traced over Tristam's hip and thigh and he arched and cried out softly as Tristam's fingers caressed his jewel. The brunette then moaned as Tristam entered him with aching slowness, filling him as deeply as possible. Rayner sagged back against his bigger mate.</p><p>"That's it, angel," Tristam murmured. "Let me take care of you, love."</p><p>Tristam kept his movements slow and tender and at an unhurried pace that nudged his lover's hidden sweetness gently. He refused to give in to his baser desire to thrust harder or faster, keeping the pace steady, content to feel his lover's increasing arousal and know that they were spiralling towards a shared zenith.</p><p>"Love you, angel, love you so much. Want to come with you."</p><p>Rayner shivered at the deep guttural tone, the sound as arousing as the touches to his body. He was beyond words, beyond thinking, letting himself simply feel and trusting his mate to take care of all he needed. He came crying Tristam's name at three gentle pulls to his swollen flesh. As his own seed fountained over his husband's hand he felt wet heat fill him, Tristam moaning his name into his neck.</p><p>Rayner did not know whether it was minutes or hours later that Tristam slipped from his body and he felt his lover's sadness at the loss of their connection that echoed his own.</p><p>"I don't want to let you go. Come back safe to us, Tristam," he whispered as he turned to bury his face against his husband's broad chest. He bathed his husband's nipple with his tongue, sucking on the large nub.</p><p>"I have the greatest incentive any man could have; a beautiful husband and our unborn waiting for me. Relax, angel. Let me just hold you." Tristam's strong arms encircled Rayner. He smiled as he heard soft snuffles of sleep from his mate within minutes. However, he remained awake, holding to his precious bundle.</p><p>****</p><p>Theophilus lay languorously in the nest he shared with his husband. His hair fanned over the cushions like golden silk. His legs were spread wide and the reptilian's tail was deep inside him, caressing his sweet spot whilst a talented tongue was wrapped around his aching shaft. Theophilus arched and moaned as Xavier worked his body masterfully. The long, forked tongue moved both up and down as well as contracting and relaxing, but all movements were tender and unhurried. Theophilus shifted to be able to stroke the smooth head of his lizard mate and over the aural depressions, a sensation Xavier especially enjoyed. The blond knew he was fast approaching completion and he whimpered his mate's name over and over.</p><p>"Xavier!" Theophilus finally cried as his living essence pulsed free.</p><p>The reptilian was closely monitoring his lover and knew when his beautiful mate was reaching his climax. Mindful of his maw of sharp teeth, Xavier carefully closed his mouth over Theophilus' erection and drank down the sweet elixir. He used his tongue to milk his lover of every precious drop and then stretched alongside his husband.</p><p>Theophilus was now taking a supplement that helped to ensure he was not so easily fatigued and Xavier was hoping to bring his beloved to a second, shared climax. His tail stroked the satin skin of an inner thigh as his fingers toyed with nipples that adorned slightly swollen breasts.</p><p>"I will miss you so much, my husband," Theophilus mourned sadly, burrowing into his mate's strong arms.</p><p>"As I will miss you, my heart," Xavier replied honestly, stroking his love's tresses.</p><p>"I wish I could be with you," the blond said, his golden eyes sorrowful.</p><p>"I will have Uist, beautiful," Xavier smiled reassuringly. "You will need to take care of Rayner and Sholto. Rayner will especially worry being away from, and out of reach of, his husband. Your role here will be as every bit as important as ours, beloved."</p><p>Theophilus smiled and peppered the reptilian visage with kisses. As hard as being apart from his husband would be, he intended to take his responsibility for his more newly pregnant brothers very seriously.</p><p>"Please, my husband," he whispered, "be inside me."</p><p>"Are you able to pleasure yourself on my flesh, beloved?" Xavier asked.</p><p>Theophilus' smile became wider, a reflection of genuine happiness. He was proud of being less tired than in the first months of his pregnancy and knew how much Xavier enjoyed the sight of him astride the big reptilian. He arose gracefully, his golden hair rippling over his shoulders and down to the small of his back. He straddled his lover's large body, raising himself ready for Xavier to unsheathe his twin hemipenes. He could feel how slick and ready he was and the sensation of his mate's sexes at his entrance sent frissons of arousal throughout his lithe frame.</p><p>As Theophilus settled his body to take Xavier inside him, the lizard gave a low trill of pleasure and joy. He relished every time he was able to make love with his beautiful mate and it was especially arousing for the reptilian knowing Theophilus bore their child. His tail wrapped securely around the blond's waist as Xavier's long, sensitive fingers traced over the gentle swell of his husband's abdomen. Theophilus was already undulating and squeezing his internal muscles, driving the bigger male towards completion. Xavier cupped his mate's sac, rolling the precious orbs before stroking the slender rod that was slowly refilling to bob elegantly in time with Theophilus' movements.</p><p>Xavier's hands began to trace warm, soft skin from Theophilus' throat, across his shoulders and over his nipples, tweaking them with meticulous precision as his tail spiralled around his lover's shaft contracting and relaxing in harmony with the blond's motions. His mate's face seemed lit by a beatific glow as he worked both of them to a shared release. He gave his own smile as golden eyes ablaze with love and desire opened to look down on him.</p><p>"I love you so much, my husband."</p><p>"And I you, Theophilus," the reptilian replied.</p><p>The blond moaned, dropping his head back and pushing his chest into Xavier's touches as he felt his mate form his knot and the tail around his own erection changed movements to a ripple effect from root to tip and back again. He began to pant softly as he undulated on the hard flesh impaling him, the ripples around his aching shaft increasing incrementally with his movements. Heat suffused his body and a tingling seemed to permeate every cell before his seed flowed up in a pearlescent arc to spill over Xavier's pale-green skin.</p><p>Xavier watched as his husband reached his zenith and he was rewarded with his precious silver. With a groan of Theophilus' name, the reptilian's own elixir filled his mate's spasming sheath. Even before Xavier's orgasm had ended, Theophilus slumped and the lizard held him safely as the last of his seed filled the beautiful blond mammal. He cradled the slighter body close, smiling as Theophilus sagged completely, letting Xavier take care of both of them.</p><p>"Be safe, my husband. Come home safely with our brother," Theophilus whispered. He nestled across the broad chest of his mate, held tightly by arms and tail.</p><p>"I will return, my heart. We will all come home safe to our loved ones. But you know how important it is for Tristam to try and rescue someone who seems to have been genetically altered in the same way as he has. It has become a very personal mission to him."</p><p>"I will take care of the young ones," Theophilus vowed, as he stroked his mate's frill, earning a low purring trill of pleasure from his mate.</p><p>"I know you will, beloved," Xavier said. He was so proud of his husband. He gave silent thanks for the brave and compassionate younger male he had been so blessed with. "Sleep safe, my heart. Let me take care of you whilst I may." Xavier began a low musical trilling as he rocked his lover, feeling the caresses to his frill slowly falter and stop. He was quite certain he would not be the only one keeping a voluntary vigil over a beloved mate that night.</p><p>****</p><p>Rayner, Sholto and Theophilus paced or sat, their faces reflecting their worry. They barely registered the luxury of the apartment in which they were housed or its view of the immaculately tended parkland. They were currently willing themselves not to constantly ring their Papa. They knew Jameson was the central hub of information for all that was happening, but realised equally that he needed to be free to receive calls from their husbands rather than themselves.</p><p>Theophilus moved to stand behind Rayner and gently massage the shoulders he could see were tense with anxiety.</p><p>"Tristam will take no chances, my brother," he said in reassuring tones. "You are his world. As you are Uist's," he smiled, as Sholto ambled over to lean against him. He draped an arm around the smaller man trying to infuse both younger males with confidence.</p><p>That the sharing of comfort and support had come full circle came as no surprise to any in the room. They were all part of a diverse and extended family. When one was in need, they knew they could rely on succour from the others. Rayner stood to bury his face in a slender shoulder and a deceptively strong arm encircled him protectively.</p><p>"They will *all* come home safe," Theophilus said emphatically.</p><p>The buzz from the videophone had the three men hurrying to take the call and they held their breath anxiously at the sight of a grim-faced Jameson.</p><p>"There has been some unexpected activity at the space station that Uist and Xavier were investigating," the older human said, his eyes flicking from Sholto to Theophilus. "Communications are down and I've sent in another ship. It could be a day or so before I can communicate properly with them. As far as I have been able to establish they are unhurt, but stranded and no longer able to transmit to me."</p><p>Unconsciously, Sholto and Theophilus' hands reached to each other and their fingers entwined, each man conveying solidarity with the other.</p><p>"Do you need us to take 'Silver' out?" Rayner asked, trying to think of action they could take to help their family.</p><p>"No, Rayner," Jameson replied. "You are needed here. Tristam is already returning with his ... cargo. He has very short range communications, but I can confirm he is on his way home and all is well. He will soon rendezvous with Darius and can speak more openly then. Just a few more days, boys and this will all be successfully concluded."</p><p>"Thank you, Papa," Rayner smiled.</p><p>"I'll be in touch as soon as I hear more from your husbands, boys," Jameson said, looking at Sholto and Theophilus.</p><p>As the older human's visage faded, the three males hugged tightly. Whilst there were still some concerns over Uist and Xavier, they all believed Jameson when he said it was nearly over.</p><p>****</p><p>Sholto had opted to remain at the apartment whilst Theophilus and Rayner drove out to meet Tristam and his rescued prisoner. The entire building was monitored and protected by Elite-trained security and Jameson had felt that the freed prisoner would be more relaxed if they remained with Tristam for a day or so until less overwhelmed by their new-found liberty. Then they could all meet when Uist and Xavier returned. It was important to the older human that there was no suggestion that there had simply been an exchange from one set of jailers to another. All the two men knew of their guest was that they shared enhanced senses like Tristam and were struggling to manage control.</p><p>The dark and light men scanned the crowds looking for the man that was husband, Protector and leader. Both gasped in unison.</p><p>The couple walking towards them could have been brother and sister. Despite Tristam being over six feet in height, the blond woman at his side was only an inch or so shorter. Height, build, hair colour, the similarities were almost uncanny. Their heads were angled towards each other as though no one else existed and they held each other's hand.</p><p>Rayner fought down a sharp, shard of jealousy at the way his husband seemed engrossed with the eerily alike woman. His mate's blue eyes then looked up and saw him and the mental caress he had sorely missed drove all unkind thoughts from his mind. He gave an incandescent smile and enthusiastic wave and he led the way towards the couple.</p><p>Tristam released his hold on the woman's hand as Rayner moulded tightly to his broad body, sighing his happiness.</p><p>"Tristam, I don't like it here." The woman's voice was husky and low, but the tone was that of a petulant child.</p><p>"I am Theophilus," the slender blond said, catching hold of the woman and pulling her towards the car. He knew Rayner needed a moment alone with his much missed mate. "I will take you to our car. It is quieter there."</p><p>He was surprised at the lack of enthusiasm from the blond woman, her attention rapt on Tristam and Rayner. He managed to get her inside the vehicle and got in beside her. The look of pure venom she gave him almost took the Dregan's breath away.</p><p>"You're not human and I don't like you," she hissed malevolently.</p><p>"No. I am not," Theophilus agreed. Then gave his own voice a brittle tone. "And I care not whether you like me."</p><p>The bald statement seemed to deflate the woman and she sat silently and sullenly. Theophilus felt guilty at his lack of empathy for the woman. She had been a prisoner, genetically altered ... and he inexplicably disliked her. He would do all he could to make her feel safe and secure, but his main priority was looking after his brothers. She would have many people to ensure she was well cared for soon enough. He glanced out at Tristam and Rayner as they ambled up to the vehicle, Tristam's arm possessively around Rayner's waist and each gazing lovingly at the other.</p><p>"Regina," Tristam said. "I want you to meet my husband Rayner and this is Theophilus who is as a brother to me."</p><p>Rayner smiled at the blond woman, but got a cold stare in response.</p><p>"I want to sit with you," she whined.</p><p>"You'll be fine with Theophilus," Tristam said.</p><p>"I don't like him. I don't like it here. I want to go home."</p><p>"You're coming to our home for a couple of days whilst you get used to being out in the world. We also want to make sure no one is going to come after you. Soon you'll have your choice of wherever you want to go," Tristam replied, his voice soft and soothing.</p><p>The atmosphere in the vehicle was so thick with tension it could have been cut with a knife. Regina insisted on petting Tristam constantly and smirked triumphantly at Rayner when the brunette turned hurt eyes at his mate who seemed oblivious to the touches. Theophilus simply wanted to slap her for the spoilt brat she seemed to be despite her apparent adulthood. He was also angry that Tristam seemed not to notice Rayner's growing discomfiture as his husband failed to stop Regina's touches.<br/></p>
***
<p><b>Silver 7 Beauty and the Beast</b></p><p><br/>The lithe body moved as sleek as a seal through the water, blond hair restrained in a loose plait. Swimming was excellent exercise for an expectant father, ensuring Theophilus kept supple and stretched without overexerting himself. It was not as though he could purposely exhaust himself. An attentive husband kept a close watch over his pregnant mate, as did the rest of his family. These few months would be the most physically tiring as the baby he carried grew rapidly. Theophilus rolled onto his back and floated, caressing the swell of his belly and smiling.</p><p>Sometimes he could scarcely believe he carried a child conceived from the love he shared with his reptilian mate. His life could have been so different. He pushed the darker thoughts away, focusing on the love he knew Xavier had for him. As unexpected as this gift was, it was one that brought joy to both males, as well as Theophilus' extended and diverse family. He could not suppress his giggle of happiness. He was in the last third of his pregnancy, Sholto was approaching mid-term and Rayner was just a few weeks behind him. Theophilus looked forward to all three births eagerly, although he knew his would be the most difficult.</p><p>He gave a squeal and giggle and strong teeth nibbled along the underside of his legs to nip carefully at his buttocks and then he was in Xavier's strong arms, laughing as his mate lifted him clear of the shallow water. He rubbed his face affectionately against the beloved reptilian visage.</p><p>"Beautiful," Xavier murmured as he carried his mate securely against his chest. Pregnancy had been difficult for the blond, but Theophilus had never complained, too enraptured with the thought of carrying their child to be anything less than happy. At the moment, relaxed and well rested, the blond positively glowed. Xavier's carefully created supplements had eliminated Theophilus' early nausea and now helped counteract the exhaustion that would be prevalent.</p><p>The group had taken a break from any active missions whilst the pregnancies ran their course and whilst their unknown enemy remained at large. As such, Xavier's main work in the lab was finding the best combinations of supplements for the younger men. Sholto was still suffering from pregnancy sickness, whereas Rayner was simply tired. The big lizard was happy to devote his time and skills to make the three pregnancies as easy as possible for his brethren. In between, he spent as much time as he could with Theophilus.</p><p>Theophilus wriggled alluringly as Xavier teased his tiny opening with his tail. He carefully laid his precious bundle on a comfortable nest of cushions and pillows topped with big thick towels. Soon it would be too uncomfortable to join with his mate when they made love and the reptilian intended for them to enjoy intimacy as often as possible whilst they still could. He guided Theophilus' smooth legs around his bulk, his hands caressing the delicate swell of his husband's abdomen and his tail probing insistently until Theophilus entrance acceded to the erotic demands and flowered open. As his tail slid into the hot, tight sheath, Xavier gyrated it carefully to caress his mate's hidden jewel.</p><p>Theophilus moaned his appreciation as one of Xavier's hands stroked him whilst his tail worked inside him. He gave a soft, impassioned cry of Xavier's name, holding Xavier's head to his breast, as the forked tongue slid around a sensitive, rose-pink nipple, squeezing with care and flicking seductively over the taut nub. He spread his legs further, arching his back. He writhed and mewled, his hair coming free from its plait to flow like golden silk around him.</p><p>"Please, my husband," he pleaded softly. "Please."</p><p>Xavier honoured the request, unsheathing his hemipenes and sliding them into Theophilus blood-hot channel to a low purr of appreciation from the blond. He felt the long limbs tighten around him as his lover tried to take him deeper.</p><p>"Gentle, my heart," he chided gently, his tongue slipping into his mate's mouth to a muted mewl from the younger man. "I will love you as you desire, but let me do all the work."</p><p>"I love you so much, Xavier," Theophilus whimpered quietly. "I need you."</p><p>"I am here, beloved and I will take care of you as you wish." He formed his knot, letting his shimmering sexes rub against his mate's sweet spot. His tail rippled from root to tip over Theophilus' engorged shaft, one hand sensually tormented the over-sensitive breasts and his tongue thrust rhythmically into the blond's softly panting mouth.</p><p>Theophilus was caught up in the amatory assault. He felt as though his husband was making love to his entire body and the flames of desire, carefully built up by the reptilian, were now scorching unchecked through every cell and synapse of Theophilus' body. He moaned wantonly, trying to convey his pleasure, trusting his mate would understand. As much as he wanted to keep watching the adored face of his husband, the golden eyes fluttered closed as supernovae began to detonate before his eyes. His musical cry of Xavier's name was harmonised with a low trill of pleasure from his reptilian mate and, as his seed arced from his shaft, he felt liquid heat filling him.</p><p>As his orgasm finally ended, Theophilus' body slumped replete. He opened heavy-lidded, satiated orbs to watch his husband lick him clean. The long, agile organ laved his chest, carefully lapped at his sated sex and tenderly cleansed his hidden entrance. As much as he wanted to reciprocate, his body seemed too heavy. A leaden hand reached his lover's head, stroking tiredly at the aural depression it could reach and petting desultorily at the lilac frill.</p><p>Giving his unique smile, Xavier arranged their bodies until his mate was cradled comfortably against his chest, his tail stroking Theophilus' thighs, as his hand rested over the small swell of his belly.</p><p>"I tire so quickly, even with your help, my husband," Theophilus whispered. He let his body relax against his mate's bulk and nestled comfortably in the protective embrace.</p><p>"Your body takes care of the child growing within, beloved," Xavier replied, his hand rubbing over Theophilus' warm skin. "You need more rest whilst he grows."</p><p>"Am I a burden to you and our family?" Theophilus asked anxiously.</p><p>"Never," Xavier assured. "You take good care of Sholto and Rayner. Your presence settles Sholto almost as well as anything I can produce. You carry a precious gift within you and it will not be long before Sholto and Rayner tire as quickly as you do as their babies grow. You, at least, have been spared the sickness that plagues Sholto."</p><p>The couple spared a thought for the auburn-haired human and his PrideHomer husband. They had gone to spend a couple of days on PrideHome with Uist's sire and sibling. It had been under strict secrecy, the couple in disguise and under assumed names. It was likely to be the last off world visit any of the couples made until after the birthing. Theophilus and Xavier waited aboard 'Silver' for the rendezvous with the returning couple, a couple of Elite ships in near proximity, and then all would return to Jameson's home and Rayner and Tristam. A soft smile played around the blond's lips as he slipped into satiated slumber. He had missed his brothers and was looking forward to them all being together once more.</p><p>****</p><p>Uist's head rose slowly. He had been awake for a few minutes, using his senses of scent and hearing to ascertain if anyone else was in the room. He detected nothing except a septic aroma that irritated his sensitive nose. His mate was not there. He was alone.</p><p>Naked.</p><p>And secured at ankles and wrists to a cold, smooth wall.</p><p>His arms were raised as high above his head as they could be. His ankles were held by metal bands that kept his legs spread wide apart. His genitals had been pulled from their protective pouch and he could feel they had been as scrupulously cleansed as the rest of his body. He knew he had been given an enema and the thought of unseen, unfelt hands touching him so intimately had his rage simmering. He assumed the vulnerable pose was intended to magnify his helplessness. He could be touched at will by his captors but, instead of increasing his vulnerability, it increased his rage. However, as a seasoned Warrior, he kept his face schooled into impassivity.</p><p>Across the room was a small cot bolted to the floor. It had a metal rail around it which had a long chain ending in a single manacle attached. A screen encircled a chemical toilet, which Uist could scent along with antibacterial hand wash. His eyes flitted around the rest of what was little more than a windowless, grey box. He spotted the small camera, its green eye glowing balefully. He assumed the room would be wired for sound as well as vision and let all his rage and hate centre on the green light.</p><p>"I'm glad to see you awake, Uist," a disembodied voice came from the direction of the camera. "As you can see, you are unhurt and have been cleaned and tended by my medical staff. Unfortunately, your mate's pregnancy meant he was more sensitive to the gas we used to drug all aboard your vessel. He will be joining you soon. We wanted to ensure he had recovered from his nausea, and associated difficulties, before bringing him here."</p><p>"If harm befalls my mate or my unborn there will be no safe place in this universe for you to hide," Uist snarled.</p><p>"I assure you, Uist, it is not my intention to harm you, Sholto or his baby. So long as you both co-operate neither of you will be hurt. Attempt to escape and you will be punished. You will bear punishment for anything Sholto tries and equally, he will be punished if you try anything. Sholto will be brought to you in a few moments."</p><p>Uist growled dangerously. He could not purposely endanger his mate and unborn. However, if he got just one, safe opportunity to deal with their kidnapper...He gave another low snarl of fury as Sholto was escorted into the room. His mate was also naked and looked pale and dishevelled, the lingering sent of pregnancy sickness still assailed Uist's nostrils. At the cat-man's instinctive sound, Sholto raised his head.</p><p>The guard stared openly at the attractive young male, a hand going to Sholto's shoulder, preventing him from going to his restrained mate. His eyes flicked briefly over to Uist at the feral snarl in response to his unwelcome touch. However, it was the angry voice from the camera that had his hand snatched quickly away.</p><p>"You were ordered to keep your hands off him. Sholto, you may have a few moments with your husband."</p><p>The younger man did not hesitate, moulding his body against the solid bulk of his mate and soaking up the warmth and scent. He felt Uist rubbing his scent glands against him, knowing the PrideHomer would be trying to replace the stench of unknown hands on him with his own unique scent. He breathed deeply, letting the familiar and beloved scent calm his still-churning stomach and frayed nerves.</p><p>Uist could smell sickness, fear and others on his mate. He hoped his musk would help settle his lover. He was pleased they were given the time to nuzzle before the already-detested voice spoke once more.</p><p>"As I have told Uist, the rules here are simple, Sholto. If at any time you resist or disobey an order, or attempt to escape, your punishment will be borne by your husband as his will be by you. You will now return to your guard."</p><p>With a parting kiss, Sholto reluctantly returned to where the guard stood. He stood passively as the manacle was locked around his wrist. The guard made no attempt to get any closer than necessary. Sholto tried to hide his concern that their captor could instil such fear in his own men. As the guard quickly left Sholto slumped, defeated, on his cot.</p><p>"Now you may both meet your permanent jailor. I can be assured he will neither disobey his orders nor attempt to touch what is forbidden to him. Meet Beast."</p><p>Both Uist and Sholto stared at the being that lumbered into their cell. If its shoulders had not been hunched, it would be as tall as Uist. The arms were loose-jointed, which suggested at suppleness beyond the norm and terminated in gnarled hands with razor-sharp claws. Its legs were thick and powerful. Its visible skin seemed to be scaly. Its face was morbidly fascinating, comprising a skull that was misshapen with a bony growth, like a ridge, a couple of inches above its eye sockets. Its nose was almost flat, with wide nostrils that quivered as it scented the others in the room. The jaw was also deformed, housing an array of uneven, sharp teeth. For all its fearsome and repulsive appearance, the most gruesome thing was the deep brown, very human eyes that gazed almost vacantly at Sholto and then Uist.</p><p>"Beast, scent the one on the wall, then the one on the cot," the disembodied voice commanded. As the creature obeyed the order, the voice continued. "Once he has your scent, he can track you anywhere aboard this station and he will administer any punishments."</p><p>Uist was neither afraid of nor intimidated by the creature and as it turned to head towards Sholto, he growled low and feral.</p><p>Sholto swallowed past his fear. The creature was just going to smell him.</p><p>"This one is special, Beast. He is bearing a child. Become familiar with this aspect of his physiology."</p><p>The creature stretched a single finger towards the swollen stomach of the dark-haired prisoner. It turned its head to see Uist snarling and yanking as hard as he was able to prevent its touch.</p><p>"Please, Uist, stop. I'm fine. Let it touch me," Sholto pleaded. In a much lower voice he added. "Please don't hurt my baby." He closed his eyes as the deadly claw reached closer. However, the touch was so light as to be barely noticeable and, as he opened his eyes, he could see the creature had angled the finger to avoid the claw from potentially scratching his skin. He saw a flicker of ... something ... in the beast's eyes, then the almost-vacant look was back in place.</p><p>"Your stay here is only temporary whilst more suitable accommodation is prepared. We want to ensure your child has a home, after all."</p><p>Sholto felt nausea roll through his body. The thought of his baby, born in the clutches of this man was almost more than he could bear. His hand rubbed over the swell of his belly.</p><p>"We will be found," Uist growled.</p><p>"Oh I'm afraid there is little time for your 'family' to be looking for you. Tristam has been infected with a synthetic virus, effectively rendering his body immobile and shutting off all his senses. Pretty Rayner is naturally at his side and the lizard is trying to find a cure. I can assure you that the delicious Dregan is distraught at your disappearance, but they have more than enough to deal with without trying to find you. You are dismissed, Beast. "</p><p>Uist used every ounce of his Warrior training not to scream his fury and pain. He had heard the lust in the mocking voice when speaking of Theophilus. Rayner's pregnancy was still early and this kind of stress could easily create a problem with his body's acceptance of the artificial womb. His eyes took in the slumped figure of his mate, sitting dejectedly on the small cot. The owner of the loathed voice may not know it, but he was a walking dead man.</p><p>****</p><p>Two full days had passed since Theophilus' world had been turned upside down. Uist and Sholto had vanished, the entire population of the ship they were aboard drugged to kidnap the couple. Almost simultaneously Tristam had been struck down with a paralysing virus. The blond's head pounded with pain and he tried to give a genuine smile to his chosen brother as Rayner stroked his brow. Tristam seemed to be in a coma, unresponsive to any external stimuli, but not to the mental touch of his mate.</p><p>An unexpected side effect to Tristam's condition was his forging a mental link with the blond. Tristam, exclusively communicating with his mind, somehow connected with the blond's inherent empathy and drove it one step further. It allowed Theophilus to remain at Tristam's side whilst Rayner took short breaks. Although Theophilus was overjoyed to be able to do *something*, he still felt it was too little. A true telepath was on his way, but their species preferred to keep their distance from non-telepathic ones. Additionally, Jameson was desperate to keep news of Tristam's vulnerability hidden and so the family friend they chose was still a day or so away from arriving. The mental connection was painful for the Dregan, his mind unused to working in such a way and headaches were frequent for the blond. It was hoped the telepath could both help him strengthen his neural pathways as well as actually communicate with Tristam.</p><p>Theophilus gamely tried to play down the pain, but was unable to hide it from Rayner as the younger men each got used to the feeling of the other in their mind. In addition to Theophilus' nascent ability, another source of future celebration was that his baby reacted to the mental touches of Tristam and Rayner. His eyes grew heavy as his body responded to his pain and growing exhaustion. He felt Rayner's hand move to stroke tenderly over his small bump. The three younger men had taken to rubbing oil over each other's stretching skin to help it retain its suppleness as well as a way of relaxing and enjoying a time of shared intimacy. It made the pain of Sholto's absence even more sharp. As his eyes closed he made a mental vow. 'I have not forgotten you, Uist and Sholto, my beloved brothers. I swear I will not leave it to others to find you.'</p><p>****</p><p>When Theophilus' eyes next opened, he was carefully wrapped and snuggled in the nest he shared with Xavier and, in his husband's absence, was clinging tightly to one of Xavier's lab coats. He rubbed the material over his face, his antennae quivering as he scented his beloved mate. He gave a sad sigh. They were in Jameson and Aurora's home and his husband flitted, well protected, between the hospital facility and the house as he tried to counter-act whatever afflicted Tristam. Theophilus had no doubt he mate would succeed and believed Tristam got more from the experienced touches of Rayner's mind than his own. A tear slid down a porcelain cheek as he rose stiffly, caressing his swell. He *had* to do something. He needed to be looking for Uist and Sholto. There had to be a way he could. There *had* to be. As he stepped from the room, he saw Jameson coming towards him.</p><p>Jameson saw the glint of the crystal tears and hurried to envelope the lithe body in a tight embrace. He was unsure of the cause of the tears, knowing it could just be the youthful male's changing hormones. However, he wanted to offer any comfort he could to Theophilus. Although he and Aurora had fostered many children, they had only adopted three; Tristam, Rayner and Theophilus. The blond would therefore present them with their first grandchild and he had already suffered greatly during what should have been a time of joy for all the family.</p><p>"Oh, Papa," Theophilus finally husked, "I feel so useless."</p><p>"Nonsense," the mature male countered. "Without you Tristam would be alone and adrift when Rayner needs to rest. You care for Rayner when he feels despair and you carry your baby, our first grandchild. You contribute greatly, son."</p><p>"But Uist and Sholto are still missing. I need to do something to help find them. Please, Papa?"</p><p>"Xavier will be back soon," Jameson mused. "Go to your Mama and make sure you eat properly," he chided gently, smiling as Theophilus' cheeks tinted pink. "If Xavier agrees, you can come to HQ with me and review everything we have. Perhaps your sharp eyes will see something another has missed."</p><p>"Truly?" Theophilus asked, his smile emerging like the sun after rain. He hugged Jameson tightly, his step lighter as he hurried to the kitchen to find Aurora.</p><p>Jameson watched the retreating figure with a loving smile. He made a mental vow to ensure he kept Theophilus close to him if Xavier agreed the blond could go with him. He moved to the bedroom of his other sons. He gave a saddened smile as Rayner looked up and bent to hug and kiss the brunette before kissing the cheek of the blond who lay so unmoving. The sight was like a dagger in his heart and Jameson's hand moved to caress the swell of Rayner's abdomen, a gesture he unconsciously copied from Theophilus.<br/></p>

<p>Pelaam© June 2008.</p><p><b>Ch 08: Nemesis</b></p><p>The luxury car was opened by an immaculately uniformed doorman for the smartly dressed executive. He slid comfortably inside, his emerald-green eyes running appreciatively over the car's interior. The seats were leather and roomy and, if needed, could be slipped into a fully reclined position. There was a laptop computer for work and a store of DVDs for entertainment. A small fridge held cold drinks and snack food and there was a matching cabinet holding glasses and drinks that did not require chilling.</p><p>He ran a hand through thick, silver hair as he smiled at himself in a reflective surface. The negotiations had gone well. He now faced a couple of hours drive to reach a tiny airport and from there to a space-port. The world only boasted a few small space-ports, but as its status increased, so would its number of ports.</p><p>Immersed in his reports, and taking advantage of the drink provided, it was an hour later that he realised that his car was taking a tortuous route to the airport. They had left the main road and were currently travelling at speed towards the desert in a circuitous direction to his destination. He rapped on the glass behind his chauffeur.</p><p>"I have no desire to take the scenic route," he barked angrily. His voice had a dry, rasping quality yet possessed power and impatience. It was the voice of a man clearly used to the obedience of those around him.</p><p>"Sit back and enjoy the ride, Jabez. You're taking a little detour."</p><p>Before a darkened screen blocked off Jabez's view of his driver, he caught a glance of him in the vehicle's mirrors.</p><p>"Tristam!" he exclaimed. He tried to use the vehicle's communications and then his own only to find nothing working. His eyes narrowed, becoming as hard and cold as the gem whose colour they bore. Then he shrugged, poured a generous measure of amber liqueur and sat back, lifting his glass in an ironic toast to the now invisible back of his driver.</p><p>****</p><p>Jabez glanced around, his face carved into an expression of boredom. The car was out in the desert. All that could be seen was red rock and orange sand and overhead the sky was a cloudless turquoise as the two saffron suns each reached their zenith.</p><p>"Out of the car, Jabez," Tristam's voice commanded.</p><p>"And if I don't?" Jabez retorted, not even bothering to turn to face the man now standing at the door.</p><p>"Then you stay there."</p><p>Jabez watched as Tristam walked over to sit in the shade of an outcrop of rock. He noted the cool-box from which the blond took a bottle of water. He had been quite certain the other man would not be alone. He idly wondered who else would be watching from the cover of the desert rocks. He also wondered just how long Tristam was prepared to wait. He poured himself another drink. Five minutes passed, then ten...fifteen. Jabez frowned.</p><p>Tristam was paying neither him nor the car any obvious attention. He purposely waited another fifteen minutes, but Tristam simply looked as though he was drowsing in the desert heat. Scowling, Jabez re-filled his glass and began a slow, deliberate saunter to the seated man.</p><p>As he closed the distance, he begrudgingly admired Tristam's obvious, latent power. The blond sat loose-limbed, a dusting of golden fur visible where he had unzipped his chauffeur's uniform. Tristam oozed male, sexual charisma. Jabez gave a wry smile as found his eyes riveted to the other man's movements as Tristam sat up slowly and raised a fresh water bottle to his lips.</p><p>Jabez watched the bobbing motion of Tristam's Adam's apple and coveted the droplet that escaped to slide down the skin of the blond's throat. He bedded both sexes with equal fervour and appetite. Although he preferred beautiful, malleable and accommodating bed-mates he would be more than happy, at that moment, to have the powerful blond on his knees as he slaked his carnal appetite. The surge at his crotch told him his cock was in full accord with that idea. At that moment, sapphire met emerald and Jabez smirked at the disgust in Tristam's cerulean depths.</p><p>He stopped as Tristam stood up. The two men were almost equal in height and breadth and each regarded the other as though something dangerous and volatile.</p><p>"So, Tristam," Jabez let his voice become a low purr. "What brings you to this little nowhere rock? Were you missing me? I've never been kidnapped before. It's a nice isolated area. Are you going to have you wicked way with me? Is it my face you picture when you orgasm inside pretty Rayner?"</p><p>Tristam's stomach rolled in disgust at Jabez's words. Almost immediately he relaxed as a gentle caress flitted through his mind. His beautiful husband might not know the reason for his mate's distress, but the loving touch instantly defused Tristam's anger. Instead a slow, scornful smile spread across his face.</p><p>"Such a vivid imagination, Jabez," he drawled laconically. "Perhaps it's more the case of you dreaming of being taken by me. Sorry, but I don't cheat on my husband. I've no need and you pale into nothing alongside Rayner." He gave a mental smile at the darkening of Jabez's face. The blond knew from personal experience that conceit and arrogance were two of Jabez's weak spots.</p><p>"Wasn't it enough that you all but destroyed my employer's long-established business, Tristam? Are you looking to destroy me, too? Perhaps I should consider a charge of harassment."</p><p>"Hiram Enterprises was investigated by multiple teams of Elite across several worlds," Tristam said slowly, as though addressing a child. "My team investigated your domain and found exactly the same as the others. Hiram Enterprises was employing unethical, inhumane and illegal methods. It was only Hiram's reputation, almost limitless access to funds and an extremely well-skilled legal team that stopped him...and the likes of you...from being incarcerated as was deserved."</p><p>"We lost every contract to supply and develop weaponry for the advanced worlds. It cost us billions in credit. We can only supply hick planets like this with basic stuff sold cheaply until we can rebuild our reputation," Jabez hissed.</p><p>"You deserved worse. Quite frankly I would happily see you and Hiram behind bars for a good many years," Tristam growled. "That you're free to trade at all is a miscarriage of justice. But that's not why we're here."</p><p>"No?" Jabez sneered. "Then what?"</p><p>"Hiram hasn't been seen in public for many years, but you are his eyes and ears. So I want you to deliver a personal message to him. Tell him I know, my family knows. Bloodfeud has been called by Willis, sire of Uist. Wherever Hiram hides, we will find him and be avenged."</p><p>"Is that all?" Hiram asked mockingly.</p><p>"I think that's more than enough," Tristam said, his voice cold and menacing. He had seen the shift in the hard, green eyes and had scented Jabez's surge of anxiety. The man was clearly well-aware of what Tristam alluded to. "But if not, tell him this. Bloodfeud extends beyond PrideHome. Phixia has joined its call as has one of the Aantnaa worlds. Sholto has some good insectile friends."</p><p>Tristam felt grim satisfaction wash over him as Jabez's anxiety increased. The insect-evolved races were renowned for their well-structured society and lawlessness was unknown amongst those dwelling on their homeworlds. Sholto's friends had reacted with fury and a desire for vengeance on hearing of his abduction and treatment as well as what had happened to the others of his family.</p><p>"What are you expecting from him?" Jabez asked.</p><p>"The opportunity to give himself up. To stand trial rather than be dug out from whichever hole he's taken refuge in, confessing his guilt in regards what has happened to me and those I love. Have no doubts, Jabez," Tristam said, his voice dropping to a deadly whisper. "He will be found and those who have had a part in this will also be dealt with."</p><p>He scented Jabez's spike of fear knowing he had struck home.</p><p>"Just the belief you know something is enough for me to kill you. But, this time, you go free. Make sure he understands, Jabez and make sure you understand that if I find you were involved there will be no place of safety for you."</p><p>Jabez stared at Tristam's retreating back, a mix of anger and fear coursing through his veins.</p><p>"Another car will come for you in an hour," came the parting words, the blond not even bothering to turn back.</p><p>****</p><p>In their quarters aboard 'Silver' Rayner sat astride his husband's thighs. He gently undulated his body, letting their swollen shafts rub erotically. Tristam's hands slid along his thighs, over his pregnant swell and up to tease at the peaked nubs at his breast. A moan slid from his parted lips and he gazed down at his mate, smiling at the love he saw there and knowing it reflected the look in his own cinnamon orbs. His smile widened as their minds added subtle caresses to incrementally increase their arousal.</p><p>"Better?" he asked, knowing how his lover had felt whilst facing Jabez.</p><p>"Much," the blond sighed contentedly. He had debriefed those of his family unable to accompany him, taken a hot shower with his beloved mate and finally felt clean and calm. For several long minutes the couple had simply enjoyed skin-to-skin contact but he could feel the need for more growing. He watched Rayner as the younger man begin to rub with a little more urgency. "Let me make love with you, angel?" he asked, suddenly desperate to join with his mate.</p><p>With tender care, he laid Rayner on his side, spooning tightly behind him. Coating a single finger with oil, he rubbed over the hidden entrance to his lover's body, pressing kisses to the bare shoulder in front of him. He nuzzled into Rayner as he slid the digit into molten heat, both men moaning at the intimate act. He reached under and around his lover's waist to stroke slowly at slick, erect flesh, relishing the way his mate eagerly responded. The lithe body pushing back and rocking forward as soft cries of pleasure escaped Rayner's lips.</p><p>"Love you so much," Tristam whispered.</p><p>"Love you, want you," Rayner murmured, trying to increase the tempo of their lovemaking.</p><p>"Gently, love," Tristam soothed. "Let me do all the work." He slid a second oil-drenched finger to begin a caress of Rayner's jewel. Reluctantly he removed his fingers. It was too uncomfortable for his husband to take more than just Tristam's fingers. Although he missed the ultimate physical intimacy, Tristam would do nothing that caused Rayner the least discomfort during his pregnancy.</p><p>Spooning closer Tristam pushed his aching shaft between Rayner's smooth thighs. He started with a slow rhythm, his rod continually weeping its desire and sliding easily back and forth. Incrementally he increased the pace, listening assiduously to the panting breaths and mewls of delight. His hand began a twist and flick at the top-stroke of his movement at the head of his mate's engorged penis, causing Rayner to groan and buck as much as his position would allow.</p><p>"Come for me, angel," Tristam husked. "Take me with you."</p><p>At the words spoken with such raw need, the heat that had been centred low in Rayner's belly began to expand outwards with searing intensity. Rayner's breath came in shallow pants as he felt every cell and synapse melting from the heat of his imminent climax. It was impossible for him to tell if the pleasure he felt was just his or entwined with his lover's as they mentally shared their race to release. He cried out his lover's name as his orgasm detonated and his seed fountained over Tristam's hand.</p><p>"Love you, I love you," Tristam groaned. The waves of pleasure in his mind combined with the feel of his lover's passion pushed him beyond his limits of endurance. He came hard, shuddering with the powerful release and anointing his lover's honeyed skin with his come.</p><p>He licked at his hand, relishing the flavour of his mate's precious cream. He carefully rolled Rayner onto his back, licking the smooth thighs clean, before nuzzling at Rayner's depleted sac and lapping the softening, spent flesh. He bent over the supine form to mate their mouths, their tongues languidly dancing in the satiated afterglow.</p><p>"I love you," Rayner smiled, seemingly glowing with joy. He nestled comfortably against his bigger mate and gave a sated sigh. He snuggled impossibly closer as Tristam's arm wrapped protectively around him and the two men traded soft kisses and declarations of love.</p><p>****</p><p>On the main deck of 'Silver', Uist sat in the command chair, Sholto curled drowsily in his lap. Although the ship's AI was on full alert, they no longer felt safe enough without someone on deck. Uist wanted to let his precious mate sleep more comfortably, but knew Tristam and Rayner needed time to reconnect and it was too close to Theophilus' birthing for the blond to be an active part of the team.</p><p>It was difficult for the PrideHomer to allow any of the pregnant males to be too far from his protection and he was relieved that they took his protectiveness with good grace. He smoothed some of his lover's curls from the beloved face, smiling as Sholto murmured wordlessly and snuggled closer.</p><p>Uist knew Theophilus and Xavier would be in the ship's pool where the Dregan could move most easily, the water supporting his heavily pregnant body. The blond was now at his most vulnerable. He could not be left alone as he was nesting for his imminent birth. Once the instinct kicked in, he became oblivious of anything other than making somewhere safe and comfortable to have his child.</p><p>Uist's smile grew as he remembered some of the places the blond had selected. One nest was at the foot of the bed he shared with Sholto, another was in Tristam and Rayner's room. Whilst they were acceptable, another behind a section of piping in engineering was not. The cat-man shook his head, still finding it hard to believe the blond had negotiated his body in and around the metal tubing. Unsuitable nests were quickly removed and Xavier informed. Uist knew his lizard brother would make certain that Theophilus was left with only those nests the reptilian considered appropriate...and safe.</p><p>The knowledge that Theophilus, Rayner and Sholto were not free to have their children openly and in safety had the big male growling angrily. He wanted to crush their nemesis' larynx, tear out his spine, rip his intestines from the still living body and he had no cares as to how primitive or bloodthirsty those thoughts were. His mate and child had been threatened as had those he loved and protected. Any PrideHomer, aware of the invoked Bloodfeud, who came across Hiram would run him down and rend him apart.</p><p>He pushed the thoughts from his mind as Sholto shifted restlessly as if aware of the direction of Uist's thoughts. He nuzzled lovingly, purring to settle his mate. He lifted the hand Sholto had possessively on his breast and kissed the palm before replacing it. He smiled as Sholto settled. He let his own hand cover his lover's pregnant swell, grinning as his child seemed to know and moved beneath it. There were few placed he felt truly safe but at that moment, his lover in his arms and his child shifting beneath his hand, he was at peace.</p><p>****</p><p>On a nest of thick towels and sumptuous pillows, Theophilus lay on his back as Xavier pleasured him. The reptilian's long tongue slithered over his swell, along his sensitive inner thighs, over his sac and from root to tip and back along his erection. The tip of his husband's tail teased along his shadowed declivity but did not try and penetrate.</p><p>"Close, my husband, so close," he moaned softly, reaching to caress his lover's lilac frill.</p><p>A gentle pinch to a swollen pink bud as Xavier's tongue probed at his slit and Theophilus cried out his mate's name as he reached his zenith.</p><p>Xavier was not surprised that despite his climax, Theophilus did not ejaculate. His precious mate was too close to birthing. It would only be after his body had recovered that he would start producing his seed once again. The lizard was filled with a mix of anticipation and apprehension. Although they had a name, their adversary was still an unknown quantity.</p><p>He moved to kiss his lover as Theophilus finally recovered from his climax. His tongue flicked in and out of Theophilus willing mouth, the blond stroking at Xavier's smooth skin.</p><p>"Thank you," Theophilus whispered, already he was finding it difficult to keep awake. As much as he loved carrying Xavier's child, he hated the debilitation that pregnancy brought with it.</p><p>The lizard gazed tenderly at his beloved. Theophilus tried so hard to keep going even when his body protested. The Dregan had been particularly active in helping to nurse Alden following the beast-man's bouts of surgery. Xavier had deemed it less stressful to let his mate be a participant in Alden's care than for the blond to be worried.</p><p>To everyone's delight Alden had come through his initial recovery from injury exceptionally well and through a couple of further bouts of surgery intended to work on replacing his destroyed eye and facilitate better speech.</p><p>"Sleep, my heart," Xavier whispered. "I will be here to watch over you."</p><p>He tenderly covered the already drowsing blond with a large, soft sheet and sat at his mate's side. He was worried, as were Uist and Tristam. He was also angry that the happiest time of their lives was being tainted. He felt Hiram knew too much about Tristam, even for a man of his wealth. He prayed that their defences were sufficient to protect their vulnerable ones from him.</p><p>A noise had him instantly on his feet. He relaxed as he saw Rayner, wearing just a loose shift, with Tristam behind him.</p><p>"May I stay with you and Theophilus?" the brunette asked. "Tristam wants to relieve Uist and I'm too tired to sit up with him."</p><p>"Rayner?" Theophilus opened sleepy, golden orbs and then raised an arm in invitation.</p><p>With a little assistance, Rayner was manoeuvred to lie alongside the blond, both younger males asleep in seconds.</p><p>"He will be fine here, my brother," Xavier assured.</p><p>****</p><p>Uist was grateful to Tristam for giving him time to be alone with his mate. Sholto was now lying on their bed, his legs spread wide, his erection hard and leaking. Uist knelt alongside the supine form, his tongue licking every precious inch of his mate's skin. Uist's lips mated with his lover's, no longer gentle and tender, but searing and passionate. Uist then moved his kisses down Sholto's jaw and to his neck, sucking and biting lightly. As he traversed his lover's skin, he heard Sholto cry out softly at a harder bite between his neck and collarbone, but Uist soothed away the hurt with a laving tongue and a swirling lick.</p><p>"Mine," the cat-man growled, needing to mark his mate.</p><p>"Yours, Uist, yours, yours," Sholto moaned.</p><p>Uist moved on to the furred chest, pressing moist kisses across Sholto's breast. He suddenly sucked a nipple into his mouth, his tongue playing over the peak.</p><p>"Oh, please," Sholto gasped, hips jerking up involuntarily. White-hot fire shot straight to his groin, his already rock-hard erection oozing tear after tear of need. In response the big male bathed his nipple in small kitten licks, his fingers pinching and tweaking the other one making Sholto twitch and moan. Sholto's hands ran through Uist's hair, feeling its texture and petting his lover as well as holding him to his chest. Uist knew how sensitive his nipples were.</p><p>Sholto let his eyes fall shut as Uist switched to the other nub, suckling it as his fingers teased the one previously in his mouth. Sholto was certain he was on fire. Uist's licks and nips were slowly and incrementally stoking the inferno of love and desire that was consuming him. His shaft was begging for contact, silver trails glistened in the thick pelt of pubic hair and his lightly furred abdomen. Sholto let his hips rise and fall, whimpering softy, and rocked his head from side to side.<br/></p>

<p><b>Silver 9 Retribution</b></p><p>Pelaam© August 2008</p><p>Willis gave a soft smile as the blond wandered almost aimlessly towards him. The golden eyes were slightly unfocused and a cushion was clutched tightly against Theophilus' stomach. Willis pulled him close, turning the lithe body so that Theophilus' back pressed tightly to his chest. The blond head that now lay back against his shoulder began nuzzling at the area his scent glands were hidden. He combined releasing his musk with a slow, deep rhythmic purr that reverberated in his chest as he caressed the blond's swell.</p><p>He frowned as he felt the agitation beneath his hand. If the child was moving so much, surely Theophilus must be about to birth. He glanced up as Xavier and Jameson appeared.</p><p>Xavier sighed as he gratefully took charge of his young husband. A soft whine of pain escaping from Theophilus' lips as awareness came into his eyes and he blinked rapidly as Xavier made soothing noises. His beloved mate was so very close, but as yet had not settled to start the process of bringing their child into the world.</p><p>"Sorry," Theophilus whispered. "I do not know how long this will continue."</p><p>"There is nothing to be sorry for, little one," Willis said, cupping the blond's face and kissing the smooth cheek. "Your child will come when ready and we will just have to wait."</p><p>Xavier had found no Dregan medic willing to leave their world to assist with his husband's pregnancy no matter what incentives he offered. All had tried to induce Xavier to return Theophilus from his exile to have his child but the reptilian, and all their family, had been against any such move. All he could gather, after copious payments, was that Theophilus was behaving perfectly normally for a pregnant male and that there was generally little or nothing that medical experts could do to assist birth anyway.</p><p>The nesting instinct, however, was not usual for Dregan males. Many voicing that it was due to Theophilus carrying a half-Phixian child. Creating a safe nest was common for Phixians of both sexes when ready for birth. From the little he had gleaned, the blond's body would know what to do when the baby was ready. He fully intended to record every process so that, for any other child they might have, modern technology could assist. He dare not even offer pain relief for fear of disrupting Theophilus' body's natural behaviour.</p><p>Theophilus was lying longer each time he went into his nesting phase. It meant that friends and family, present for the birth, were milling around in and out of the house along with those specifically designated as security. No one was able to truly settle whilst the blond was still hovering on the cusp. However, no one was complaining, all were anxiously waiting the moment when the baby was ready to enter the world.</p><p>"Come back outside, my heart," Xavier urged. "You seem to prefer the outdoor nests."</p><p>Jameson and Willis watched as the blond was led away by his protective mate.</p><p>"Uist asked me to wait inside," Willis explained to Jameson. "He is certain Sholto will not last full term and does not want his mate to move around unduly. He was therefore torn between the two of them, not happy that Theophilus is still mobile and wandering. He is equally sure however, Theophilus will ultimately select an outside nest and is waiting there. Of course the fact that he is keeping Sholto and Rayner beside him and encouraging Theophilus to lie in the nest they are beside adds weight to that theory," the older PrideHomer laughed.</p><p>"I hate the fact we have to use so much security," Jameson grumbled. "This should be a time of joy."</p><p>"Theophilus is aware of little beyond his imminent giving of birth, my friend," the cat-man said, affectionately taking Jameson's arm and leading him back towards the extensive rear garden. "When he wants comfort he instinctively seeks out those he loves and trusts. There is a small army of guards, but he has gone to none of them. We are the ones whose joy is marred and then only as much as we let it."</p><p>"I wasn't aware Uist thought his child would be early," Jameson added thoughtfully as they stood at the French windows. "I know Tristam has some concerns, his child is also restless and is a couple of months further away from full term than Uist and Sholto's."</p><p>"If you were to ask me," Willis said dropping his voice. "I would say there is a bond between the children yet to be born that is as strong as that their parents share. Theophilus' baby is preparing to enter the world and I believe the others wish to do the same. Tristam and Rayner's child is more telepathic than its parents. Theophilus' empathic abilities developed into an additional basic telepathy, almost by sheer willpower when Tristam was incapacitated, which it is thought he shares with his child."</p><p>"But there is nothing of that kind with Uist and Sholto." Jameson said.</p><p>"Who knows what the brain may become capable of? There are some in my Pride whose mental abilities exceed that of the norm. It is not something we speak of. It is a talent we keep as tightly guarded a secret as that of our Warriors. Whilst Uist is not amongst them and Sholto has shown no such abilities, neither Rayner nor Tristam showed it at an early age as I understand. They needed each other for it to bloom. And here we have two children who seem to have such a talent and so perhaps the third will also be blessed. I would like to think it will be so. Better all three share the gift to some extent. Now go and keep an eye on our beautiful blond. I pray his child comes soon."</p><p>****</p><p>At the same time as Jameson wandered back into the garden, his image was watched by a group of men who had stopped their vehicle where they could covertly view the older man's home.</p><p>"This the place?" a gruff voice asked.</p><p>"So the Boss says," an equally uncouth voice responded. "We snatch the Dregan and his half-breed. This little viewer taps into their security cameras so we can see exactly where he is and when he's whelped. Shame we can't hear what's going on," he added. "I can almost count the credits we could get for the information we could gather from this lot. Boss was disappointed this was only picking up visual, too."</p><p>"I heard there were Aantnaa," another voice offered. "And PrideHomers."</p><p>"Doesn't matter what they are," the second voice scoffed. "The weaponry the Boss has provided will take care of them all. Knock them all senseless whilst we whisk away the prize from under their noses. The Boss must want him badly. It's the best price we've ever been offered for a job and he's supplied the forged security paperwork, the Elite uniforms, the weaponry, this little viewer. Everything we need to breach their security and make our escape. All we have to do is get in there, get the blond and his kid and get out. Easiest credits we've ever earned."</p><p>"He good for the credit, Doane?" the first man asked. "It's a king's ransom."</p><p>"He's already deposited a third, Jaimin. This lot must've cost a fair bit, too. He'll deposit the second third when I call him to say the job's been a success. I get the last on delivery. You men will get to our rendezvous. Me and Liko will make sure we get the boy to the Boss. All we have to do now is wait. Let's move off. There's no need for us to get too close with this little baby," he added smirking as he waved the viewer. "With the credit from this job, we'll live like princes."</p><p>Raucous laughter and coarse words greeted the declaration and the vehicle took up another vantage spot from which to view the house's proceedings.</p><p>****</p><p>Rayner lay on the bed, knees bent and legs spread wide, as Tristam's tongue slowly slid over his skin. Their unborn seemed to be as agitated as Theophilus'. As the blond was yet to fully settle, Xavier had effectively ushered them away to spend some quiet time away from the general melee and possible influences of others' anxiety. From his vantage point, kneeling over Rayner's supine form, his husband was currently lapping diligently at his nipples and Rayner sighed his pleasure. He moaned and arched as best he could as his mate nibbled carefully at the taut nubs. The gentle ebb and flow of their shared pleasure was echoed faintly by the child he carried and he smiled.</p><p>Tristam's tongue was like wet velvet, soft and warm, dipping lower to lave just above his swollen abdomen. Licks became open-mouthed kisses as Tristam traversed his swell. Lower again and Tristam licked his aching shaft that twitched eagerly for the loving caress. Next his testes were given a thorough bathe before each precious orb was rolled carefully in the blond's mouth. Kisses were dropped down the inside of each wide-flung inner thigh, each shin and to each foot.</p><p>"Tristam," Rayner moaned as he wriggled his toes enticingly.</p><p>Tristam gave into his lover's silent request and brought the twitching toes into his mouth and let the taste explode on his tongue. He ran his slick muscle over, then under, the foot at his mercy. He played with the small digits that were now wiggling in his mouth. Suckling slowly, sensuously, he stopped to watch Rayner unhurriedly stroking his arousal.</p><p>"So good, Tristam," Rayner whispered as he clenched and unclenched his toes. "More please," he panted closing his eyes and moving his hand a little faster.</p><p>Tristam groaned at the erotic tableau. Rayner was lost in the intimacy of the act. It had been a while since he had indulged his mate this way. He brought the right foot up letting his thumb stroke a circle on Rayner's inside ankle. He used his other hand to stroke himself to perfectly equal his lover's tempo. Their link allowed him to match Rayner's inexorable ascent to reach his climax. Their shared pleasure was thick and heavy in the air and Tristam's nostrils flared wide as he breathed deeply. The combined scent of love and arousal made his shaft throb and he growled approvingly. His hardness was slick with his leaking juices and he could scent that Rayner's was the same. He licked his lips, his eyes devouring the small foot he held.</p><p>Rayner cried out as Tristam laved a long stripe with his tongue from his heel to the tip of his big toe. He whimpered pleadingly as the digit was then taken into wet heat and sucked to the same rhythm as both men worked their shafts.</p><p>"Oh, Tristam, so close," Rayner moaned, although he knew he did not have to speak. Tristam would know just how close he was from the feeling of elation that was just a heartbeat, a hair's breadth away from consuming them both. His hand was gently batted aside and he groaned low and deep as a strong, masterful hand encircled his hot flesh to stroke. Rayner's hands gripped tightly to the bedding as he was propelled towards a shared zenith.</p><p>"I can't hold back anymore," Tristam panted, his hips involuntarily thrusting up into his hand as he worked his lover's smooth, hard flesh.</p><p>"Don't, love," Rayner whispered. "Come for me, oh, love," Rayner moaned tossing his head back and forth on the pillow. Those words were the last coherent thought that he had before his shaft pulsed freely, covering Tristam's hand and himself.</p><p>As the jet of precious crème poured forth Tristam bit the arch of the foot that was still in his hand and then roared his completion. His seed adorned the satin thigh of his mate. As he began to descend from his orgasmic high, Tristam took the time to lave the spot he had marked so lovingly. He licked his hand and then Rayner's smooth skin, devouring eagerly every drop of their shared passion before stretching cat-like at his lover's side.</p><p>Rayner smiled as he nestled close, certain Tristam was purring just like Uist did when particularly happy. His smiled widened as he felt his child's echo of their shared joy.</p><p>"Good job Tymon has volunteered to each our little one how to use his telepathy responsibly and not invade minds as he grows," Tristam murmured, his own grin matching Rayner's.</p><p>"And how we can shield ourselves when needing privacy," Rayner giggled. The musical sound became a soft moan as Tristam's mouth covered his and a knowing tongue made its home inside his warm depths.</p><p>They lay trading loving kisses and then both jumped, their eyes wide.</p><p>"It's time," Rayner said, his hand covering his swell where his child was moving agitatedly.</p><p>The couple were already dressing as a voice, in a mixture of excitement and apprehension shouted through their door.</p><p>"Theophilus has settled. Hurry."</p><p>****</p><p>Tristam and Rayner hastened to take their place. They found Theophilus in the outside nest that had found most favour with Uist. Rayner smiled at the tableau. The blond was stretched out fully on his back with a sheet covering the lower half of his body. The family patriarchs: Willis, Jameson and Laban all knelt by his feet ready to be the first, other than Xavier himself, to welcome the child into their family. Uist was on Theophilus' right, the blond's hand clasped tightly. Tristam moved to take Theophilus' left and Rayner to kneel alongside Sholto. The auburn-haired young man had Theophilus' head pillowed on his knees and was already dabbing a damp cloth across the blond's brow.</p><p>Rayner noticed that the air was heavy with the scent of PrideHomer musk and low, rhythmic purrs. He glanced down at his brother-of-the-heart. The normally vibrant golden eyes were semi-glazed and he realised that the scent and sound were not simply making the blond more relaxed, but actually slipping him into a semi-sedated state. The PrideHomers selected as security, as well as the guests were contributing to the hypnotic melody. He heard a counter harmony from the Aantnaa who had attuned their own chirrups to a cadence that helped Theophilus.</p><p>"They know, don't they?" Sholto whispered to Rayner as his hand traced over his own swell. "Mine started kicking just before Theophilus stretched out and now he's settled."</p><p>"Same here," Rayner nodded. "Uist and Tristam don't think ours will wait their full terms. I don't either." He felt the love from Tristam reach out to him. He let it fuse with his own for his husband, for his child, for Theophilus and all their so diverse family and sent it to flow gently into the blond's mind. He gave Sholto, Uist and Tristam dazzling grins as Theophilus' hitherto expressionless face relaxed into a soft smile.</p><p>Xavier knelt watching as his beloved husband began the process of birthing and the gentle smile that softened the previously blank face. He glanced briefly at Tristam and Rayner, knowing in some way the smile was in response to them, He had no words to express the gratitude he felt to those of the varied races and families all around them who now actively contributed to make it easier on Theophilus to bring forth their already much-loved child. He swallowed as he saw the thin line of red that began to ooze at the point from where he would deliver their baby. He raised his head.</p><p>"It begins," he announced. All his attention was then rapt on his precious mate, silently praying that all would go well.</p><p>****</p><p>"Whelping time," Doane laughed as he regarded the viewer in his hand. "Nothing worth watching though. Got all the best bits covered," he added to coarse laughter and crude retorts. He looked at the blond that he and his mercenaries were being paid so handsomely to kidnap. Although he would say nothing in the company he was in, he felt a stirring of lust.</p><p>The blond was indeed incredibly beautiful, in face as well as in body, and he could understand his Boss' fascination. However, there was no way he would double-cross his employer. Not to keep the Dregan for himself or to sell him to slavers.</p><p>The man who had selected him and his elite mercenaries had a long reach and no payment would rival that already agreed. A part of him almost felt sympathy for the oblivious male. If he was picking up the kind of credits to snatch Theophilus, his Boss most certainly was not just going to have the blond as an adornment.</p><p>"How much longer?"</p><p>The petulant question roused Doane from his reverie and he blinked at the viewer, angry at being disturbed.</p><p>"Doesn't look like it's quick," he growled. "I'll tell you when."</p><p>****</p><p>Xavier was unaware of the passage of time as he monitored his mate and their child as the birthing continued. He watched in awe as Theophilus' body finally opened enough to allow him access to the baby. The cadence around him seemed to swell to a crescendo as he lifted free the small bundle, still swathed in a protective sac. He tore the gossamer covering away to gaze at the tiny miracle he and Theophilus had created.</p><p>The baby was mammalian in features except for vertically slitted amber eyes and the tail that curled around Xavier's wrist. The skin held the palest of green tints and there was a thick covering of short, platinum-blond hair on the skull. Father and son locked eyes silently for a few seconds and then he threw back his head and bellowed, the sound echoed by his son's wail and the gathered Phixians.</p><p>"Jameson, your grandson," he said, handing the baby to the mature human.</p><p>"Welcome to the family," Jameson husked, earning himself a muted noise from the child in his arms before passing him to Laban. He smiled as the elder Phixian lifted the child high once more to another bellow from the gathered reptilians.</p><p>Willis stared at the young life passed to him from the large, lizard male. Although no bloodline linked them, Willis felt the instinctive protectiveness for a familial cub wash over him. Grandfather and grandson regarded each other silently for a few seconds before the PrideHomer mimicked Laban's actions.</p><p>"Welcome to my Pride, little one," he murmured. "My first grandson," he shouted aloud. Then he and the PrideHomers gave their own roar of welcome. He passed the child to Uist and watched smiling as one-by-one Theophilus' chosen brothers added their personal welcomes before Tristam handed the baby back to Xavier.</p><p>"We have a son, my heart," he whispered tenderly to Theophilus, unsure how aware his husband would be.</p><p>"Son," came the barely there whisper. The dreamy smile widened marginally as the newborn was carefully cradled against his chest. Theophilus felt Tristam and Uist released their holds on his hands as he tried to hold his baby. Theophilus knew it was Uist who was fussing as he felt a cover enfold him to ensure his son remained secure against his heart.</p><p>Xavier let the cat-man arrange the newborn at Theophilus' breast and then instantly reverted from husband to physician. He started by checking that his mate's body was beginning the process of closing over now the child was delivered. He waited for the computer to display the requested information regarding Theophilus' vital statistics to verify his beloved husband was well and healing. He smiled. It would seem that it was going to be a problem-free event.</p><p>He glanced around at the gathered family and friends and then the large marquee that had been set up. Once the welcoming of the infant had finished Jameson and Aurora, in the role of Theophilus' parents, would usher their guests inside. As soon as Theophilus was well enough to be moved, the three days of celebrations, that accompanied a birth of a new PrideHomer or Phixian, could officially begin.</p><p>The reptilian smiled as he saw Jameson glance over at his wife as she wiped away a tear, his hand reaching to his own cheek to find unnoticed wetness. Xavier glanced back to Theophilus then to Jameson, knowing the mature male was waiting for him to conclude the welcoming ritual.</p><p>****</p><p>Doane watched as the big lizard began to reach towards the blond's body. He grinned. All he needed now was to see the blond seemed recovered. His eyes never left the screen, watching intently. Eventually his patience was rewarded.</p><p>"Heads up, boys," he said. "Time to collect our booty."</p><p>He and his six men strode from their vehicle to the gates of Jameson's home. Doane swiped a card and pressed his face against the retinal screen for his eye pattern to be checked and verified. He turned and grinned at his men as the scan checked and the first gate opened. His nodded approvingly as the rest of his men copied his actions and they stood in a specially constructed area between the initial gate and access to the front gardens. Doane took a deep breath as a second gate swung open and an Elite leader stood ready.<br/></p>
