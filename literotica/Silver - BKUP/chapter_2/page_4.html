<p>"I do not need to give you a climax to take your DNA, cat," she said. "However, I will break you and your precious Tristam. You will both be my sex toys and come when I dictate. Perhaps next time, we will have a little time to play this way first."</p><p>Uist looked at the small innocuous looking device in Beckla's hand. He did not know what it was, but knew it could only be something unpleasant. Beckla positioned the device at Uist's breast. He was unable to prevent a grunt as a surge of electricity passed through his body. He could hear Beckla's cruel laughter as she moved the device over his body: on his other nipple, his sac, pressed against his hidden entrance and finally three rapid bursts along the length of his still erect flesh. He sagged panting, his chest heaving with the exertion. His only consolations were that he had still resisted release and apart from the one sound, had remained silent.</p><p>Beckla smiled as she watched Uist try to regulate his breathing. She moved away to the door and then returned.</p><p>"Behold the future army of Wraithe," she hissed.</p><p>Uist gasped as he saw a creature spawned from nightmares. The creature was supported by six multi-jointed, thin legs. The body seemed to have a soft underbelly with a chitinous back. From the insect-like body arose a humanoid torso with two arms ending in three, claw like fingers and with spines at the upper arm. The head atop the torso was devoid of hair. There were three pairs of cold red eyes that seemed to look through Uist. The abomination's mouth was complete with mandibles and a proboscis that unfurled and furled as it tasted the air around it.</p><p>"You could call her my daughter, I call them Spider-Wraithes" Beckla cackled as she refastened her lab coat. "I implanted my superior eggs, genetically modified, in the wombs of inferior caste females. Much as I am doing with the women who came here. So far I cannot conceive more than three spawn in either a natural mother or a host. They are delivered in an egg sac and immediately latch onto live food, to drink its blood before devouring the still living flesh. That is how your Beta will end his life as the other two have done so already."</p><p>"No!" Uist bellowed, truly afraid for the first time. He strained against the bonds, but their strength held. The thought of his beautiful mate, and the two other beautiful young men he loved, as living food for these creatures was almost too much for him to bear.</p><p>"I am only able to spawn females and they only produce one set of eggs," Beckla said unheeding of Uist's frantic struggles. "With your DNA and that of your compatriot and some of the more suitable males amongst those here I hope to improve them even further. Their limited intelligence needs a little enhancing, too," Beckla muttered as she began to leave the room. She stopped at the doorway and gave Uist a malicious smile. "I couldn't let you see the deaths of Rayner and Theophilus, but you can watch your Beta die." She ordered the creature from the room and closed the door on Uist as he screamed his frustration.</p><p>A movement on the screen had Uist's eyes moving rapidly to watch. Sholto still lay bound, but was no longer unconscious and was no longer alone. An egg sac had been left beside him and already the spawn were beginning to break free. Uist's own scream matched the silent one of his young husband as miniature versions of the creature Beckla had brought to him latched onto him. As his cry of anguish ended, a red haze descended over Uist's vision.</p><p>**********</p><p>The Spider-Wraithe turned at the noise. It inclined its head as it looked at the door. Its orders were very specific. To ensure that the mammalian male it had been shown in the other room did not escape. The door flew open and the Spider-Wraithe scuttled back a few steps. If it had been capable of facial expression, it would have shown confusion. Instead its head rocked from side to side. This was not the male it had been ordered to guard. This was a completely different entity: taller, bulkier, more powerful, covered with thick, dark fur and armed with long, sharp teeth and claws. The Spider-Wraithe took another couple of steps back at the low, feral growl. A new feeling, one the Spider-Wraithe being had no word for, prickled throughout its body.</p><p>The primitive cat-being that was Uist hissed at its enemy as he scented fear.</p><p>He lunged.</p><p>His prey's fangs and claws slid off his dense fur. His own claws failed to penetrate the solid casing of its back, but had found the underbelly to be soft and vulnerable. In addition, the Spider-Wraithe's legs were frail and broke easily under teeth and claws. Slashing furiously as the creature buckled beneath his onslaught, Uist's body became covered with slime and gore. He kept his roar of triumph silent as he ripped apart the flailing Spider-Wraithe. An egg sac was pulled from its dying body and the would-be hatchings crushed. Satisfied his enemy was dead; Uist located his mate in the adjoining room. Snarling furiously, he attacked the hatchlings on Sholto's motionless body, shredding and crushing them with unrestrained ferocity.</p><p>He opened a wall-mounted ventilator's hatch and left the grille lying on the floor. He then prised open one of the metal plates on the floor. Beneath the plate was a small crawl space. Tenderly, whining his distress softly, he gathered Sholto's inert body in his arms. He nuzzled the pale face before tucking the smaller man securely to his side. As he slipped into the crawl space, Uist was careful to replace the metal plate to ensure this was not recognized by his other enemies as his escape route. As he began to move, his nostrils flared. He recognized familiar scents. He whined his distress once again. The taint on his mate was also on these beloved scents. Determinedly, Uist began to move towards perceived safety.</p><p>******</p><p>Since their brothers and compatriots on the mission had left, Tristam and Xavier and those remaining with them had worked hard. They had secured the area to keep an escape route back to their ships and the barracks area was now a stronghold for them to repel attackers. Tristam's unease grew as time passed. The soldiers had acted on his instruction even though he had no evidence other than instinct that something was wrong and they were in great danger.</p><p>Xavier whirled at the scream from Tristam and he raced to where his brother and commander now knelt, hands gripping tightly to his head.</p><p>"Rayner," Tristam gasped in response to the query from the reptilian. "Help me."</p><p>Between them, Tristam and Xavier pulled a metal floor plate clear.</p><p>"Take care," Xavier said grasping Tristam's arm in a gesture of assurance.</p><p>As he crawled, Tristam extended his hearing, filtering out other noises to get a physical location on his stricken mate. Their psychic link was full of pain and confusion. With relief, he found Rayner's precious rhythm; however, his joy at finding that of his mate was tempered by what else he could hear. With a choked cry, Tristam tried to move even faster.</p><p>Tristam carefully pushed the metal plate above him clear. He peered cautiously through the small gap. He fought down bile as he saw three hatchlings attached to Theophilus' body. He moved swiftly, pulling them from the inert form and using his small laser to destroy them. As he carefully eased Theophilus' body over, he gazed into the glazed eyes of his shocked lover. Tenderly cradling Theophilus with one arm, Tristam stroked Rayner's tear-streaked cheek and let his mind reach out to the younger man. He gave a sigh of relief as Rayner's eyes lost their vacant stare and focused on him. As they did, new tears fell.</p><p>"I can't feel his heartbeat," Rayner's voice was that of a small lost child. "He tried to protect me."</p><p>"He's still alive, Rayner. I need to get you both out of here quickly. Can you manage if I tend to Theophilus?" As he spoke, Tristam was releasing his husband and as Rayner's arms were freed, their mouths met in a hard kiss.</p><p>"I'll manage," Rayner said.</p><p>"You go first, angel," Tristam directed. "I'll tap your leg to indicate when you need to turn.</p><p>As Tristam pulled Theophilus close, the sound of the metal plate was the last they made.</p><p>As Rayner began to pull himself out of the crawlspace, Xavier's strong arms pulled him up and into a loving embrace. Rayner's tears fell again at the muted sound of grief from the reptilian at the sight of Theophilus, limp and preternaturally pale. He and Tristam moved to stand beside the distraught male as he began to examine the almost lifeless body. Rayner explained the little he knew as Xavier's hands moved to begin injecting Theophilus with a small dose of nanobots.</p><p>"His lifesigns are ...erratic," Xavier confessed, worry in the normally confident voice. "He needs better facilities."</p><p>A commotion behind them had them whirling round.</p><p>"No!' Tristam bellowed as soldiers' laser rifles aimed at the emerging figure.</p><p>Uist had mostly resumed his normal form, the fur being the last to fully dissipate and it was this that caused the soldiers to look with confusion at Tristam.</p><p>"It's Uist," he assured. "He's obviously been in combat." Tristam groaned his grief as he saw the limp form in Uist's arms. Two of his beloved family were badly hurt and Tristam felt his grief as a physical pain of his own.</p><p>Uist carried Sholto to where Xavier stood by the unconscious Theophilus. As the cat-man laid his precious bundle down, a choked sound of sorrow broke free as he saw the blond. A large hand, one that had so recently rendered fragile flesh, reached to tenderly caress the too pale face.</p><p>"Is there anything you can tell us that might help?" Tristam asked quietly as Uist hugged both him and Rayner.</p><p>Xavier listened as he tended to Sholto. His anger growing as he listened to the violation of his brother and team-mate and to the creation of the things that had so hurt his husband and the human that was so dear to him.</p><p>"As best I can tell, the venom in their bodies is designed to keep them alive, but unresponsive. The wounds are filled with unidentified substances that are inhibiting even the nanobots from achieving healing. That can be overcome by increasing the dosages, but I cannot do that until aboard 'Silver'. Ideally, I need one of those hatchlings alive to try and break down the components of its venom to create an anti-serum for our husbands," Xavier said at the conclusion of Uist's tale.</p><p>"But Theophilus is so much worse," whispered Rayner.</p><p>"You are not to blame," Xavier said pulling the young human tight to his chest. "I have often pointed out something of my beloved's constitution that made him more resilient than you or Sholto. He acted out of love, a selfless act that, had the positions been reversed, I know you would have undertaken yourself. As any of us here would have undertaken for another. He will not want you to regret his action. It means that four of us are fit and able to destroy this nest of evil."</p><p>"I can't just leave without trying to save some of those taken. I can do that whilst ensuring this place is razed to the ground," Tristam said.</p><p>He led his group to the last of Derrick's platoon and explained what they were up against and what it was that he had in mind.</p><p>*********</p><p>Rayner's eyes glittered with tears he fought not to shed. He hugged Uist tightly, followed by Xavier. As they turned, he was pulled to a solid chest and burrowed into his husband's embrace. Xavier and Uist had already said their farewells to their young husbands, even though they remained unconscious and unresponsive.</p><p>"You know how much I love you," Tristam said. "With my body, heart and soul. I would crawl through Hell to return to your side and I know the same to be true of Uist and Xavier. Get to 'Silver' with our fallen. Niall will rig the military shuttle to self-destruct. We will plant the mining explosives Kaz brought as we try and rescue any that can be saved. As soon as we get back, 'Silver' must be ready for immediate lift off. If anything goes wrong... you will know."</p><p>"You are my heart and soul," whispered Rayner. "There is no life for me without you. Come back safe to me." He kissed his mate with all the passion and strength he possessed.</p><p>Their training then took over, each man moving to undertake their individual responsibilities.</p><p>************</p><p>Rayner successfully ensconced Theophilus and Sholto in 'Silver's' medical facility. As directed by Xavier, he gave them a second and more powerful dose of nanobots and expertly attached Theophilus to the Intensive Care system that began to work with the blond's weakening body to stabilize him. A blast of pain from his psychic link had him heading out of 'Silver' at speed. He gave his orders about lifting off to 'Silver's' Artificial Intelligence computer and ordered a pair of soldiers to act as sentries to protect the ship as he dashed back into the complex.</p><p>He used his link to find his way to his husband. Ahead of him was Beckla. She had two of her men as well as a couple of her Spider- Wraithes. He listened as she goaded his friends and family.</p><p>"See this?" Beckla asked holding up a slender phial in which was an amber fluid. "It is all that is left of the anti-venom for my children's poison. Do you imagine that your Betas will live without it, cat, lizard? They won't. They'll die. Slowly, painfully, even though you won't be able to see or hear their pain. Inside they will scream in agony for the blessed release of death."</p><p>Rayner wasn't sure he believed everything the woman said, but he had no intention of letting her destroy or escape with the phial. Xavier needed to examine it. Opening his link to Tristam, Rayner fired at Beckla's men.</p><p>Beckla screamed in fury as her men fell. Her Spider-Wraithes, with their limited intelligence, were already programmed to attack Tristam's group and defend her. A new attack would confuse them and it would take too much time for her to re-programme them. The decision, however, was taken out of her hands. At the hiatus of firepower, Tristam, Uist and Xavier all powered forward to tackle her creations. Rayner could see a few people behind them; the dark skin of Derrick and the red hair of Kaz catching his eye. As Beckla turned to flee, he tackled her to the ground, trying to wrest the precious phial from her grip.</p><p>In the melee, his gun was kicked from his reach; however, Rayner had been reluctant to use it in case the phial was damaged. As man and woman circled each other, Rayner kept his face neutral as a supercilious smirk spread across Beckla's face.</p><p>"Do you really think you can better me, Beta?" she asked laughing. However, her amusement fell as the two engaged in a flurry of hard and fast kicks and punches. Beckla's face reflected her shock that what she considered an inferior was able to match her. Both of them had landed hard blows and blood trickled on each face as they stood panting. With a shriek of fury she flung the phial from her, hurtling it towards the floor.</p><p>Rayner reacted instantly, his reflexes exceptional. He dived to the floor, sliding along the unforgiving metal, hands outstretched. He caught the vital container before it could shatter. He heard Beckla shriek at him and peripherally saw her heading towards him. As he began to rise to try and defend himself and his prize, he saw her jerk back and rise in the air. He turned away, the phial clutched to his chest.</p><p>Beckla shrieked her fury as the phial failed to be destroyed. She ran towards the young human lying on the floor. She felt something coil around her neck and she was lifted in the air. She realized the coils were alive and she tried to prise them from her throat as they began to tighten; cutting off her air supply and crushing flesh and blood. As she began to lose her fight for life, she heard a sibilant voice thick with loathing.</p><p>"For my beloved mate Theophilus," Xavier allowed the lifeless body to fall from the coils of his tail. "May you find no peace in death," he added as he moved towards Rayner.</p><p>Strong arms wrapped around Rayner and he gazed with love and relief at the bloodied visage of his husband.</p><p>"'Silver's' ready," Rayner smiled and as Uist joined them he added, "I have the phial."</p><p>From the safety of 'Silver', the survivors watched grimly as the mining bombs and the military shuttle detonated. Of those taken by Beckla and her people, only Derrick, Kaz and one male soldier could be saved. Rayner didn't care to discover what had happened to the miners and the others. He already had enough of an idea.</p><p>Once 'Silver' was aboard the military Mother ship an immediate encoded signal went out to the Elite forces that Tristam had ensured would be nearby. The powerful ship's weaponry came to bear on the asteroid, leaving it a piece of smouldering rubble. They relayed further messages to the Federation and Tristam knew that the asteroid's destruction would have no repercussions on them or the Federation.</p><p>********</p><p>Now that Xavier was aboard 'Silver', Sholto and Theophilus' care and treatment was as good, if not better, than at any hospital in the civilized universe. Rayner assisted as Xavier directed, painfully aware that the reptilian had been training his young husband in healing.</p><p>"This is indeed an anti-venom," Xavier said to everyone's relief. A few more moments passed as the physician made his adjustments to the precious liquid. Then he injected the two pale, still forms that lay side by side.</p><p>Xavier and Uist remained in sickbay, neither wanting to move far from their stricken husbands. Xavier insisted that Tristam and Rayner get some rest. The ship's AI would advise him of any incoming messages or alerts.</p><p>As Rayner and Tristam tumbled into their room, clothes were already being ripped from over-tense bodies. They fell onto their bed, arms and legs tangling to each hold the other as tightly as possible.</p><p>"I need you in me," Rayner begged. "Join with me, please."</p><p>It was not the time for slow and sweet. Each man needed this most basic of connection to know that they were both alive and safe. Tristam's kisses were hard and possessive as he reached between his lover's spread legs to Rayner's hidden opening. His fingers thrust greedily inside the smaller man, coating and stretching, readying them for their union. He guided Rayner's legs around his waist as he surged forward.</p><p>Rayner cried out his husband's name as he was breached. Using his heels against Tristam's powerful buttocks, he urged the bigger man to move. His arms held tight around the broad back and their tongues thrust in and out of each other's mouths as they moved in concert to give and receive affirmation of love and life. Their psychic link enveloped them in an aura of love and increased the receptiveness of their brain's pleasure centres. Rayner moaned as Tristam's mouth left his to suck hard at a caramel shoulder. He wailed as hard flesh pounded against his hidden spot, bringing him ever closer to sweet oblivion without his own dripping hardness even being touched. Rayner's climax convulsed his body and his clenching channel triggered Tristam's orgasm. As Rayner's seed spread between their sweating, shuddering bodies, Tristam's was buried deep in the body of the man he loved.</p><p>Satiated and comforted physically, mentally and spiritually, the two men slept so entwined that it was impossible to see where one ended and the other began.</p><p>********</p><p>Sholto's recovery was slow, but incrementally the young man recovered to be able to leave sickbay, while Theophilus was still unconscious. Xavier was deeply touched as each of his four brothers sat their own vigil at his mate's side, allowing the reptilian time to sleep and care for his own needs.</p><p>Xavier relieved Rayner and the dark beauty went to join the others on the Command Deck. Tristam sat in the central chair and Rayner was pulled into his lap and embrace. Uist sat in another of the large, comfortable chairs, Sholto in his lap, the cat-man petting the auburn curls. Although Sholto had been up for nearly two days, he still tired easily and Uist could barely tolerate any separation. Rayner nuzzled into Tristam's shoulder as though he could absorb some of his husband's strength. Once again the young man sent a silent prayer for Theophilus' recovery.<br/></p>
