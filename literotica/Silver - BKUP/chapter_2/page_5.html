<p>"My brothers," the voice, although soft and weak had the four men leaping to their feet and racing to the Command Deck door. It was the most welcome and beautiful sound they had heard since Sholto's awakening.</p><p>Cradled safely in his husband's strong arms, Theophilus smiled at his family. He was still pale and frail but his presence, even in Xavier's arms, answered their combined prayers. Caresses and kisses were gently bestowed. At Rayner's tears, Theophilus reached to hold the young man as Xavier added his own crooning to soothe him.</p><p>"I am sorry, but my beloved is too weak to remain out of his bed long," Xavier apologized.</p><p>"Please convey to Papa and Mama that I am recovering," Theophilus whispered as he lost his battle to remain awake.</p><p>As Xavier carried his sleeping mate to their quarters, four jubilant men resumed their places, ordering the AI to open a communications link to Jameson and Aurora at their home.</p><p>*********</p><p>Water cascaded from a waterfall and Sholto allowed it to flow over him, watched by his still protective mate. Uist feasted his eyes on the lightly furred body. He had cradled his young mate since recovering, and they had found pleasure with their hands, but they had not made love. Now he admired the play of muscles and the way Sholto's wet skin glimmered. He had brought his husband here, to a small pool by his Sire's large homestead, before the ceremony to welcome Theophilus to his pride, to become the blond's Protector. The therapeutic qualities of the pool were one consideration, its privacy another.</p><p>Uist's erection was hard and needy and strained forward from his body as though seeking its true home. He waded towards the younger man, who turned and gasped at the raw need in the bigger man's eyes. Oceanic eyes dropped to take in Uist's state of arousal and Sholto's arms opened in welcome.</p><p>As arms wrapped around bodies, their erections touched and they shivered in mutual arousal. A small sound escaped Sholto's lips and Uist knew he had to hear it again. He moved his hips in a small thrusting motion and Sholto whimpered in helpless need.</p><p>Holding Sholto with one strong arm, Uist began to fist the hard flesh of his young husband. He began to squeeze and pull, Sholto remaining upright through Uist's supportive embrace. Uist's fingers fondled the taut shaft, pumping rhythmically, caressing the prominent vein and flicking his thumb over the swollen head. As his touches got stronger, Sholto's soft sounds inflamed the cat-man's own desire. A wail of his name heralded the intense orgasm that wracked the smaller body in Uist's care. Warm liquid spilt over his fingers and as Sholto recovered, panting softly, Uist licked them clean relishing the salty sweet flavour.</p><p>Uist moved to lean Sholto against a rock ledge and he felt slender fingers fondling his aching flesh. Sholto caressed the insides of powerfully muscled thighs and stroked the hard flesh, red and weeping its need that jutted from the furred groin. Sholto pulled Uist's head to his and they kissed slow and deep, tongues sliding sinuously as his hand continued to stroke.</p><p>"Need to be in you," Uist growled pulling back from the kiss. He retrieved the oil and slid two coated fingers into his mate's heat.</p><p>"Enough," Sholto groaned. "Take me now," he begged as a third finger entered and they rubbed insistently over his sweet spot, encouraging his resurgent arousal to full hardness.</p><p>Using the rock wall to help support Sholto, the bigger man wrapped his lover's legs around his waist and, bracing himself with a wide stance, lowered Sholto onto his erect shaft. Sholto gave a cry of pleasure and, under the cascading water they made love, joined physically and by their hearts. A subtle shift of Uist's strong hips and Sholto screamed as shock after shock jolted in his depths. Uist purred at the contrast of cool water and the tight heat around his erection.</p><p>Sholto moaned mindlessly as hard, thick flesh rubbed relentlessly at his prostrate. Pleasured rolled over him in waves as the water flowed over his overheating body. A bite to one of his nipples in concert with a hard thrust and a hand pulling on his erection sent Sholto spiralling into bliss. His arousal reached fever pitch and his legs squeezed brutally around Uist's waist as he erupted in a shattering climax. As his semen jetted between them he felt the hot, wet pulses of Uist's release fill him.</p><p>Carefully, not yet wanting to lose the intimate connection of their bodies, Uist walked them to the bank and stretched them to lie together on soft foliage. He tucked Sholto against his broad chest, nuzzling contentedly</p><p>"I love you, my own," he whispered tenderly, kissing Sholto</p><p>"Love you, Uist. Always."</p><p>**********</p><p>Xavier stood looking out over the lake. He and his beloved were in a high tree house on Uist's father's estate. There were another couple of tree houses nearby that homed the others of his family. One entire wall could be raised like a blind to leave the view unimpeded. It was here that Xavier was creating a special, small nest with a comfortable support for his back. He wanted Theophilus to be able to see the glorious sunset as it played over the silver lake. Already hints of pink and gold were appearing. He turned to look at his mate and his breath caught as sunlight played on his husband's curtain of blond hair, turning it to shimmering gold.</p><p>Theophilus lay on a sumptuous nest of cushions, completely naked. The sun gave his still pale skin a healthy glow. Xavier trilled in pleasure as slender limbs parted to reveal an erect member at Theophilus' groin. The younger male had been too exhausted following his ordeal to consider lovemaking. Xavier was overjoyed to see that the rest and treatment had been successful. His eyes moved to the toned abdomen and his tongue flicked out, tasting the air and Theophilus' arousal.</p><p>"I would have you inside me, filling me with the living proof of your love, my husband," Theophilus whispered.</p><p>Xavier moved to scoop the slender form into his arms and placed him in the smaller nest. Ensuring his body was securely supported, he set about arranging his beloved blond. Reclining Theophilus against his back, Xavier then hooked pale, smooth limbs to drape over his widespread thighs, opening Theophilus' body. Despite being in the open, there was no danger of being seen and Xavier relished the opportunity to indulge in outdoor lovemaking. His tail slid sensuously up Theophilus' thigh and slid into the already moist portal. As his tail began to coil inside Theophilus' body, the reptilian's hands and mouth moved over the outside. One hand slowly stroked the silk encased steel of his mate's arousal, the other pinched and rolled pink buds, whilst his tongue flicked in and out of his mate's mouth.</p><p>The younger man mindlessly moaned his pleasure, so many of his erotic zones were simultaneously stimulated. His husband's agile tail pulsed to stretch his dilating channel as the tail tip flicked back and forth over his hidden jewel. His aching shaft was tenderly stroked and when Xavier's tongue did not possess his mouth, sharp teeth bit with precision on his sensitive ears. He mewled softly his need as he felt his mate's hemipenes unsheathe to press into the small of his back. He keened and writhed to indicate his readiness. He felt his body lift, Xavier's tail withdraw and then he was being lowered onto his lover's twin members.</p><p>As Xavier felt his penises become fully enveloped by the molten depths of Theophilus' sweet body, he began to stroke the rosy rod of his mate faster. He formed his knot, ready to find his release at the same moment as his beloved.</p><p>"Oh, oh, Xavier, yes, now," Theophilus panted. As his seed flowed in a pearlescent arc that glittered with a myriad of colours from the setting sun, Xavier climaxed, his seed flooding the clenching channel.</p><p>Theophilus smiled as he came back to his senses. Xavier was still buried inside him and the sun was almost set. He purred and reached back to caress Xavier's frill as his husband's hands stroked his stomach.</p><p>"Are you imagining me filled with our child, my husband?" he asked.</p><p>"I was, my sweet. Our children will be the most beautiful Phixia has ever seen. To have you carrying life we created out of our love will be a wondrous thing."</p><p>The blond did not worry about carrying children. It was a talent of his kind, not commonly known. Even if that were not the case, medical advancements meant that even Sholto and Rayner would, when ready, bear their desired children. Xavier, as their physician, would oversee the whole process. Theophilus looked forward to seeing all their children playing together. He playfully contracted his inner muscles and was rewarded by a deep groan. "Beloved?" came the soft query.</p><p>"You waited long to be able to love me with your body. Fill me, husband."</p><p>Theophilus shivered pleasurably as he felt Xavier move within him. It took no time for a second pulsing of Xavier's sexes to leave the reptilian at last fully sated.</p><p>"Thank you, beautiful," Xavier whispered, finally allowing his knot to dissipate. "Are you tired?" he asked solicitously.</p><p>"I am sorry, my husband, but I am," Theophilus confessed. "It was a long day, and now I have two strong Protectors and a whole new family who care."</p><p>"Indeed you do, my love," Xavier said as he carried the drowsy blond back to their proper nest.</p><p>"Sholto told me of a waterfall he and Uist visited today," Theophilus whispered as his eyes closed and he snuggled into a warm embrace. "I would like it if you would take me there tomorrow."</p><p>"Anything you wish, Theophilus. Sleep now, beloved."</p><p>Xavier trilled low and soft as his mate's even breathing told him the blond was already asleep. His lips peeled back over his teeth in his unique smile. Uist had told him of the pool and the reptilian was looking forward to taking his young husband there. He cradled the soft, warm body close, settling to enjoy the rest of the sunset, satiated and content.</p>
