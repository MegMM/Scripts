<p>"Whatever else I expected here it wasn't to be greeted by three such pretty cubs," the deep voice was between a growl and a purr and the tone coloured with amusement.</p><p>"It's rare to see PrideHomers offworld," Sholto ventured. He found himself the object of an almost yellow-eyed stare. He felt a blush stain his cheeks as the flatter nose of the stranger flared to scent him.</p><p>"It would seem I'm not the only PrideHomer here," he rasped.</p><p>"Sholto is mated to a PrideHomer," Rayner supplied, "And Uist is Protector to Theophilus and me."</p><p>The large male rubbed absently at his throat before gripping Sholto's shoulder.</p><p>Sholto, I am Lachlan," he announced and preformed the same greeting to the other two men. His eyes raked over Theophilus after his greeting. His smile widened as two protective humans interjected their bodies between himself and his fascination.</p><p>"Theophilus is mated, as am I," Rayner said jutting out his jaw pugnaciously, taking on his husband's role as leader and protector of the small group.</p><p>"Yet your friend cannot be unaware of his beauty, little cub," Lachlan rumbled, his eyes continuing to drink in the attractive male. He wasn't usually given to find males appealing, but this was a rare specimen indeed. However, if he were truthful, the two humans were of an almost equal attraction. "A man may surely look." He took in the pink stain to the exquisite cheeks and wondered at the man who had managed to ensnare such a prize.</p><p>"As long as he makes no attempt to try and take that which belongs to another," Xavier said smoothly as he came to wrap a reassuring arm around his younger mate.</p><p>Lachlan's eyes widened as he took in the powerful reptilian. Of all the partners that had crossed his mind, a lizard mate hadn't featured. He saw the love in the golden eyes as the blond looked at his lover. He felt a flicker of anger at his own lack of mate. Then he was looking at the other two men. Uist and another male whose look gave him a frisson down his spine. Although appearing human, Lachlan sensed something of PrideHome about him. He watched as the dark human was pulled to his side, the gesture almost identical to that of Uist with Sholto. A gesture of both reassurance and possession and one Lachlan knew well.</p><p>"Lachlan," Uist's voice was little more than a controlled snarl. The normal PrideHome greeting of rubbing cheeks was conspicuous by its absence. The tension in the air became almost palpable and Uist gripped Sholto so tightly that the smaller man winced in pain. Uist's focus was so intense on the newcomer, he barely registered the tiny movement designed to try and release his hold slightly. Uist instinctively scented his lover, seeking the normal reassurance of the beloved bouquet. A low growl of dissatisfaction issued forth instead. Something of Sholto's scent was wrong. Although unsure quite what it was, Uist suddenly found himself needing to take his mate to their room and to reclaim that which was his. He was unaware of the concerned glances from his family at the continued aggression he displayed.</p><p>"No challenge, Uist," Lachlan said holding up his hands, palms outward.</p><p>The gesture seemed open and submissive, but Tristam wasn't so sure. From his genetically enhanced senses, Tristam could hear the accelerated heartbeat, one denoting excitement. The pheromones he could scent were a mix of exhilaration and pleasure. Lachlan was enjoying this encounter.</p><p>Striding forward, Uist left his stunned family, pulling Sholto into the lift. As it rose to their floor, the bigger male continued growling softly, unable to find comfort in his mate's scent. His hands roamed imperiously over the slighter form and Sholto made no attempt to resist. He could see his husband was deeply troubled in some way and wanted only to provide clearly needed comfort. Uist found himself becoming more feral as he pulled the unresisting form to their room and pushed him roughly inside. The need to claim and mate was nearly overwhelming. Sholto was almost tossed onto the bed and pulled to his hands and knees. His swimwear torn from his body, he yelped as two fingers scissored forcefully inside his already sensitive channel. Barely able to obey the civilised portion of his brain demanding he use the oil to slick his throbbing erection, Uist plunged inside tight, wet heat and rode his young mate hard and fast.</p><p>A frantic pumping of Sholto's shaft had the smaller man groaning with a mixture of pleasure and pain at the almost careless treatment. He'd never been taken this roughly before. He jolted forward barely able to remain on all fours as Uist rammed into him. Tears began to form and blur his vision, this wasn't lovemaking. Uist drove into him again and again before Sholto felt the big man's release inside him and the bellow that accompanied Uist's climax. Sholto shuddered his own release but it was with little pleasure. He found himself crushed tight to Uist's body as the older man stretched out, his tears falling silently. He was unaware of those that fell from Uist's eyes as realisation set in, awareness replacing the primal need to mate.</p><p>"I'm sorry, my own," Uist husked as his tears eventually ceased. He turned Sholto carefully and cradled the young man to his chest. "I'm so very sorry, please forgive me?"</p><p>Sholto gazed into the stricken eyes. He didn't think he'd ever seen his lover look so unsure. He buried his face into the broad chest.</p><p>"Of course. You didn't intend to hurt me did you?" he asked. As the vehement shake of the head he added, "I love you. But are you able to tell me why?" He was stunned to feel the slow shake.</p><p>"Lachlan and I trained together and his presence has unnerved me almost from the start. I was the better scholar, the better student of the disciplines, the better warrior and can link to our antiquity. Lachlan was always well received despite poor marks, little skill, lacking even in the grace and power of a true warrior. He is strong and competent, but no more. One of my mentors saw the effects he had on me and insisted that, as Lachlan's grades were consistently lower, he be sent to another academy. After he'd gone, things returned to normal. Even his tutors seemed surprised with themselves that they had treated him so leniently. I last heard he had graduated, but left our world. Apparently PrideHome was too restrictive and he wanted to see the universe. Once he was gone I put him from my mind."</p><p>"Till he showed up today," Sholto murmured.</p><p>"Yes, my love," Uist whispered nuzzling into auburn curls. He gave another disgruntled growl. "I felt an overwhelming need to mate with you as though our relationship was some way in jeopardy. But no matter what I should have had better control. I cared little for your pleasure, you who I love more than life itself."</p><p>"You're still unsettled," Sholto husked. "Shower with me. Perhaps Lachlan's scent lingers on me."</p><p>The two men showered quickly and efficiently, wanting the comfort of lying together. Sliding beneath cool sheets, Uist wrapped protectively around his mate.</p><p>"I love you, Sholto," he whispered. This time his mate's beloved scent was a balm to his senses.</p><p>"I love you, too. Always," Sholto vowed.</p><p>Cocooned in love, the exhausted men slept.</p><p>****</p><p>All seemed back to normal that evening as the group ate together. Uist was particularly concerned for Sholto's comfort, but his family simply accepted his solicitous attentions equitably. The sudden low growl took everyone by surprise and they glanced up to see what had caused Uist's anger.</p><p>The man approaching their table was immediately recognisable to Rayner and Sholto from their cultural and linguistic studies. The man had many titles: scientist, adventurer, explorer and was regarded as a very rich, opinionated and intelligent man. However, he was also renowned for his inability to keep an assistant beyond one 'adventure'. Some had left, tight-lipped, others returned injured to be cared for at their employer's expense. Both of these rumoured to have received bounteous levels of payment at the cessation of service. The last category was for those who never returned and whose family were duly compensated. Yet the man's reputation was legend and there were those who would still volunteer to join him on an expedition. He had been out of the public eye for some time, but he seemed in excellent health as he reached the group. Standing a little shorter than Uist or Tristam, the power and confidence he emitted seemed to add inches to his stature. Straight silver-grey hair reached his shoulders and his green eyes held intelligence as well as something indefinable as he looked at the seated group.</p><p>"Tristam, I believe," he said addressing the blond.</p><p>"Professor Denthor," Tristam countered with an incline of his head.</p><p>"Ah, my reputation precedes me as yours does you," he said amicably, his eyes sweeping across the others at the table. "Jameson said I would find you here. A holiday I believe. He thought you might be ... receptive to my proposition."</p><p>"Indeed?" Tristam replied. He, no more than any of his family, betrayed the thought that Jameson would tell nobody where they were without having spoken to them first. Their Papa was as protective of them as any father and had wanted his sons to relax following their recent ordeals. If Denthor had spoken to Jameson, he hadn't conveyed his intent to seek out the group.</p><p>"I intend to track and film a panthursa," Denthor continued as though suggesting a day's trip to the park for a picnic.</p><p>"Suicidal venture," Uist growled succinctly.</p><p>Tristam agreed. Panthursas were the largest predator on a small, remote and relatively recently discovered jungle-world that had no developed, sentient life. They stood between seven and eight feet tall and weighed over three hundred pounds. They travelled swiftly on four legs but were able to walk on two. They had immense claws and a maw full of sharp teeth and could scent blood with a similarity to sharks on Earth. The knowledge of them came from one found dead from apparent old age and the remnants of the first team of explorers from the world. Only half of whom returned. Planets like the panthursa home world were only visited for study purposes, no one would attempt to claim or develop it. However, the beast was a natural killing machine and students tended to keep as much distance from them as possible. It was deemed immoral and illegal to try and capture any creature for study. Denthor's tracking method was the only one considered permissible.</p><p>"Not at all," Denthor's voice cut into Tristam's musings. "They, like anything unstudied, are simply an unmeasured quantity. Study leads to knowledge and knowledge to power. It's time we knew more of these beasts. We can have no fear of what we know and understand."</p><p>"It is an unrivalled killing machine on the world it inhabits. Stun guns have no effect on its neurological system. Once it scents the blood of its prey, nothing deters it from hunting it down," Uist continued. He had made as much of a study of these beasts as possible. PrideHome scientists had wondered if these beasts would one day become sentient.</p><p>"I have been offered a considerable purse," Denthor persisted showing Tristam a card. The blond raised an eyebrow but remained silent as he passed it to his family and then returned it to Denthor. "I have no need of additional wealth," Denthor's voice dropped to a conspiratorial murmur. "The purse is yours for the use of your ship and a couple of your crew to accompany me to the planet. For me the acquisition of knowledge is the most valuable of rewards. As I have had access to all the information garnered on these beasts, I have managed to devise a special stun gun that will ensure we are protected. A simple and temporary senselessness and consequent disorientation to enable us to make our escape if needed. However, I'm certain such measures will be unnecessary."</p><p>"I will need some time to discuss your proposal with my team," Tristam said, as it seemed Denthor was standing awaiting an immediate response.</p><p>"Excellent," the older man said clapping his hands. He clearly seemed assured that his offer would be accepted. He handed Tristam a slip of paper with his room number inscribed upon it. "I look forward to hearing from you soon."</p><p>The group watched as he walked away and then turned their attention to Tristam.</p><p>"Imagine the charities that could benefit from such a contribution," Rayner said softly.</p><p>"I would need to establish with Denthor that we are not his employees and that we would have the full and final say over safety. He obeys us or we don't go." Tristam looked at his family. "Would any say 'no' because of the danger?" he asked.</p><p>"I think he is over-simplistic. He cannot have tried his weapon on a live subject. His opinion of himself is incredibly high. We must ensure we are in control not a glory-seeker." Xavier spoke calmly and firmly.</p><p>"It remains a foolhardy venture," Uist opined. "However, the good we could do with the figure he showed us makes me reluctant to vote against."</p><p>Tristam looked at Theophilus and Sholto who nodded their agreement.</p><p>"Then I will leave Denthor to wait overnight and tell him tomorrow that we take him provided he abides by our decisions in all things, especially safety."</p><p>****</p><p>In their room, Xavier made slow sweet love with his beautiful husband. Theophilus had been both tired and somewhat shocked by the events of earlier in the day and his mate had insisted the blond shower and sleep before their meal. Now he was enjoying taking his lover to rapture. His tail thrust desultorily into Theophilus' pink portal, the younger male's arousal ensuring he was both open and lubricated. The talented tip of his tail flicked and rubbed at his husband's hidden gem. One large, smooth hand stroked over his lover's hairless chest, pausing to pinch and roll at reddened nubs that peaked eagerly for his attentions. His other hand rolled the hairless sac between wide-flung legs. His tongue was wrapped around his mate's smooth shaft. He was both squeezing rhythmically and slowly stroking up and down with his long, ridged, agile muscle. His rewards for his diligent ministrations were sweet cries and soft mewls, arching and writhing and intermittent declarations of love and joy from the mammalian male he brought slowly to the precipice of elation. Xavier's only regret was that from his angle, bent over his husband, he was unable to fully see the look of rapture on Theophilus' face as liquid bliss flowed into Xavier's mouth. He trilled low and deep, the vibrations encouraging more of the bittersweet nectar to which he was addicted to pulse into his yearning maw. Finally the blond went limp, the hand caressing at Xavier's aural depressions and frill dropping as though of a weight Theophilus could no longer bear.</p><p>Xavier moved to lie alongside his love, drawing back his lips in his unique smile at the look of ecstasy that still lingered on his husband's face. He nuzzled at the glistening and swollen lips and Theophilus' mouth opened immediately to grant entry. The blond moaned as he tasted himself on Xavier's tongue.</p><p>"Thank you, my husband," he murmured, as the kiss broke apart to leave him panting softly.</p><p>"It is I that should thank you," Xavier whispered, "for the gift of your love as well as the sharing of your body."</p><p>"You are my love, the other half of my soul," Theophilus whispered, pressing tender kisses to Xavier's snout.</p><p>"As you are mine," Xavier vowed.</p><p>Theophilus gazed into his mate's eyes.</p><p>"Do you wish to love me?" he asked.</p><p>"I always love you, beautiful," Xavier husked. "But tonight I wished only to bring you joy. I am quite content."</p><p>"I love you," Theophilus sighed as he nestled close to his husband's powerful body.</p><p>"Love you," Xavier promised as he stroked warm, soft skin, encouraging his tired lover to sleep. The reptilian relaxed as he listened to Theophilus' breathing, allowing the rhythmic cadence to lull him to his own needed repose.</p><p>****</p><p>The trip to the panthursas home world would take several days, especially since Tristam insisted in stopping at Earth on the way to meet with Jameson, having alerted their Papa of what had transpired. From that meeting, he had established that Denthor had made no mention to their Papa of the trip he intended making. Instead he had suggested he was looking for a suitable beneficiary of his purse and knowing the charity work Tristam and his team did, had thought them likely candidates. Jameson added that many eminent scientists, from whom he had made discreet enquiries, had little time for Denthor and his reputation was quite tarnished. His recent books had sold poorly and few called upon him for his scientific input. More than one that Jameson had spoken to had thought this venture was little short of a highly dangerous publicity stunt to revive a flagging career.</p><p>There was also one more element to Denthor's presence on Silver that gave Tristam cause for concern. Denthor had mentioned he would have a travelling companion, although Tristam's definition was bodyguard: Lachlan. As a consequence of the other PrideHomer's presence on Silver, Uist was particularly unsettled. Even he was beginning to feel on edge, something shared with Xavier, although their mates seemed unaffected by the tension except in regards to worry for their husbands.</p><p>Things took a turn for the worse on the second day out.</p><p>Tristam sat in the command chair on the Silver's bridge. Rayner sat at his normal position, checking communications and keeping informed from the ship's Artificial Intelligence of anything that was happening in or around where they would be. To the left of Tristam sat Theophilus who was handling navigation. Lachlan had walked around the bridge expressing an interest in everything and then simply gazing out at the star-dusted space ahead. He had done nothing to alert Tristam until Theophilus' exasperated voice reached his sensitive ears.</p><p>"Will you please desist from standing so close to me? I do not desire you to crowd me so."</p><p>"You let the others this close to you, pretty cub," Lachlan replied, a hint of amusement in his rumbling tones.</p><p>Tristam turned to see the way Lachlan was purposely invading the smaller male's space.</p><p>"*They* are my family, *you* are not," Theophilus replied emphatically.</p><p>Tristam was about to react when Uist powered past him. Tristam hadn't heard the big cat-man arrive, but it was obvious Uist had seen and heard the exchange. However, to Tristam's horrified gaze, Uist shoved Lachlan away and yanked Theophilus to his feet, pulling the smaller man to his chest.</p><p>"Mine," was uttered in a low feral growl before Uist bit hard at Theophilus' shoulder. The blond gave a yelp of pain as red began to seep through the thin fabric of his tunic.</p><p>"Lachlan, return to your room!" Tristam ordered. "Rayner take charge of the bridge, call Sholto if need be." He turned Theophilus to view the damage as the blond stood stunned, still in Uist's embrace. "Follow me!" Tristam ordered to Uist who looked every bit as shocked as Theophilus.</p><p>Tristam ushered his family towards the sickbay. Uist now clung desperately to Theophilus, the cat-man begging for forgiveness in a constant litany. In his turn the blond held just as tightly, trying to soothe the agitated male with soft melodic crooning. Tristam caught the still shocked golden orbs and tried to convey his own reassurance through an arm that reached around them both. As they entered the medical facility, Xavier looked up in surprise.</p><p>"What is it?" he asked, unsure of who needed his attention.</p><p>"My fault, all my fault," Uist said mournfully as his hand hovered over the injury to Theophilus' shoulder.</p><p>"It was an accident," the slender male insisted as his eyes moved from his husband to his chosen brothers. "It is nothing."</p><p>"Go remove your tunic, beloved," Xavier said softly realising something was greatly amiss. "You can begin cleansing and I will join you in a moment." He gave his unique smile as the defensive posture in his young husband eased.<br/></p>
