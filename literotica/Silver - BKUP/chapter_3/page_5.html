<p>****</p><p>On the bridge, Lachlan came to join Tristam.</p><p>"I wish to apologise to you, Tristam," Lachlan finally said breaking the silence between them. "I have used my ability to sway and to unnerve in ways unbefitting of a true PrideHome Warrior. Uist has shown his right to call himself Warrior in thought, in spirit and in deed. To have hoped for his forgiveness was too much, but that he didn't even call for my punishment was more than I was entitled to expect. It is my intention to return to PrideHome. I hope to re-enter an academy and re-study to be a Warrior and if I don't make it on my merits, then so be it."</p><p>"That sounds like an admirable intention, Lachlan," Tristam nodded. "I accept your apology in the spirit in which it is offered. Uist is not the type to bear a grudge. Once he is certain of your genuine regret, he, too, will be more accepting."</p><p>Lachlan nodded silently as no further words were needed. Both men faced the star-dusted expanse that stretched before them as Silver sailed silently to her next adventure.</p>
