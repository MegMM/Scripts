[<p>The large male naked body padded as silently through the deserted corridors of the spaceship as would have been achieved in the savannahs or jungles of his homeworld. Nudity wasn't an issue. All the crew were male and the naked being knew where each one of them was at that time. That included the location of the one he now stalked. The male caught a glimpse of himself in a polished surface; a little over six feet tall, solid, muscular, powerful chest, thighs and upper arms only hinting of the real strength and power of the male. A mix of dark and slightly lighter hair reached to their shoulders. The two-tone hair also dusted their arms and legs, but his chest was hair free to display the muscles to best advantage. He flexed his large hands and checked his retractable claws and gave his image a feral smile to see strong, somewhat sharp, healthy teeth. His bright blue eyes appeared amber in the ship's muted light. When stalking prey, bright lights could hinder rather than help. The muted lighting was to his advantage.</p>, <p>Whether his intended victim was prepared to be a willing participant didn't register in the big male's mind. He needed to mate, to sheath his body in hot tight heat. He glanced down at the furred pouch at his groin. The engorged head of his sex was beginning to emerge. The pouch protected his genitals; keeping them hidden when naked as well as immobile should speed be necessary. However, at the moment anticipation was fuelling arousal. He growled an order to the ship's Artificial Intelligence. Stealth mode ensured doors opened silently and the male wanted to be as close as possible to his intended when he made his move. Many of his species enjoyed the extra stimulus of a prolonged chase before subduing their prey and under the right circumstances; it was pleasurable for him, too. However it was neither the place nor the time for such extra activities. Here, now a swift attack from a camouflaged approach would work best.</p>, <p>****</p>, <p>The young man was alone on the bridge of the spaceship. As far as he was aware only he and the ship's AI were on duty. There had been a message earlier and he expected the return of the ship's commander. If not for that ... there were more pleasurable pursuits than sitting watching space no matter how beautiful the sight. He sighed pushing away such thoughts. He had agreed to watch and wait - his decision. He pushed a slender hand through a riot of auburn hair that hung to his shoulders. Oceanic blue eyes held a hint of loneliness and a pink tongue flickered out across sensual lips before retreating. He turned his attention to the long range scanners. He could just have AI notify him when anything came in distance, but this gave him a focus.</p>, <p>Bending over the scanners, the young man was unaware of the doors opening and the large male entering the bridge. The bigger man stared with appreciation at the way the smaller man's skin-tight suit moulded itself to the taut buttocks. Without hesitation he strode forward and had enfolded his strong arm around the slighter man's waist lifting him easily, covering the mouth to muffle the cry of alarm.</p>, <p>"Want you," he growled into the nearest ear. "Want you now."</p>, <p>With a flourish, he spun the slighter form and as the dazed young man tried to bring his senses under control, pressed their lips together. He pushed his tongue inside the young man's mouth as he gasped and mapped the inside with proprietary arrogance. He used one hand to yank down the bodysuit's fastener to hip level and pull the material to mid-elbow, trapping the slighter man's arms.</p>, <p>"Uist, no," came the panting pleas as strong teeth latched onto a small brown nub peeking through a covering a luxurious chest hair. "No," the sound was little more than a moan as the neglected twin nub was pinched in concert with the teeth that worked on its mate. As teeth switched between nipples, nipping them to an aching pebbled hardness, the throbbing matched another in the young man's groin.</p>, <p>"You would not mate with me?" the bigger male asked, stroking the harness he knew he would find between splayed legs.</p>, <p>"I'm...on...duty" the smaller man gasped as his flesh was skilfully caressed.</p>, <p>"AI," Uist commanded." Advise us immediately when a craft comes within range and increase bridge ambient temperature to 90F"</p>, <p>"Confirmed," came the low female voice of the ship's AI.</p>, <p>"Now your duty is to me, your mate," Uist whispered in the young man's ear. With what sounded like a purr he rubbed his head against the smaller man's body as he quickly divested him of the offending bodysuit. Licking and nipping indiscriminatingly at any flesh within reach, the bigger man backed the smaller to the command chair before spinning so that he was seated with the smaller man in his lap. He then kissed the unresisting form deeply before arranging the young man to sit straddling his powerful thighs.</p>, <p>"You're insatiable," the smaller man huffed affectionately kissing the tip of the bigger man's nose.</p>, <p>"It has been a whole day," the reply was little short of a whine. "You had left our bed this morning when I awoke and I had duties offship the rest of the day."</p>, <p>"I'm sorry, lover," the smaller man said kissing the almost pouting lips.</p>, <p>"I would have you mate with me," Uist said, his voice dropping low and husky, the need and desire evident.</p>, <p>"I love you, Uist and I need for us to mate, too".</p>, <p>"Love you, Sholto, love you always. Share yourself with me. Let me make us one."</p>, <p>"Yes," Sholto breathed</p>, <p>In Uist's homeworld, a warrior like Uist was always the Alpha whether in a same or mixed sex marriage. The Warrior caste, like that of the Priest and Royal castes was a prestigious caste to be married into and carried ceremonial responsibilities. Uist never subjugated his young human spouse. Sholto's intelligence and individuality had been a major part of the attraction. That he was as beautiful outside as inside was a bonus for the cat-man. Some on his world preferred their mate to be displayed as little more than a trophy if marrying into an exalted caste. Uist liked to show that in many ways, Sholto was his equal. On those ceremonial occasions where it was necessary, however, Sholto behaved impeccably complying unhesitatingly with all that was required of him. PrideHome had therefore welcomed the young human. Sholto had assured his mate that he considered himself privileged to have Uist as his husband and to occasionally have to demonstrably be Uist's Beta was a small price to pay for the happiness they shared. Outside of PrideHome, however, whilst the two men regarded each other as equals, there was no doubting that Uist was sexually dominant and Sholto was more than happy with the that situation. He loved his mate's dominance in bed.</p>, <p>"Show me you love me with your body, Uist," he begged softly. Words fled the smaller man as large hands began to pump the needy flesh jutting upwards from his groin whilst sliding between the spread crevice of his cheeks and ghosting across puckered flesh.</p>, <p>With a feral growl, Uist suckled a nipple between his teeth and worried the flesh until reddened and achingly hard, then lavished the same attention to its mate. Sholto writhed on his lap under the tender assault. Uist flipped open the left compartment of the command chair and located a tube without taking his eyes off his beautiful young mate. He opened it adeptly and squeezed cool gel over his fingers before sliding a thick, slickened finger between Sholto's spread cheeks. He rubbed sensitive flesh before allowing the finger to slide into hot tight heat. Sholto moaned softly at the erotic intrusion and kissed his mate, letting their tongues dance as Uist carefully prepared the small portal that granted him access to Sholto's body.</p>, <p>Uist helped the smaller man position his hard shaft against the glistening entrance to Sholto's body and holding the younger man's hips to help support his weight, Uist groaned as he was enveloped in Sholto's molten depths. The velvet channel gripped his sensitive flesh tightly and the smaller man panted as he slowly accepted Uist's solid rod. As he finally sat flush with the bigger man's groin, Uist held himself still awaiting his mate's acceptance of the long thick shaft. Finally Sholto began to undulate, letting the head of Uist's arousal rub the special spot deep within and he threw his head back and he ground and gyrated his hips to pleasure them both. Using his powerful arms, Uist raised and lowered Sholto onto the flesh that impaled him, relishing the look and cries of pleasure from the man he loved.</p>, <p>The scent of Sholto's passion and arousal inflamed Uist and his nostrils flared as he scented the air. His movements became faster, one hand reaching between their bodies to swirl the precome over his fingers before sucking them clean. He then began to pump the slender shaft of his mate in time with the upthrust of his own hips. Four direct strokes were enough to tip Sholto over the edge and he cried Uist's name aloud as his seed fountained over Uist's hand and their chests. The scent of Sholto's release was the undoing of the bigger man and he threw back his head roaring his completion as his seed pulsed into the still rippling channel.</p>, <p>As his sated organ softened and slipped from Sholto's heated depths, the bigger male took the opportunity to lay the smaller man across his lap and cuddle him close. With a low purr of pleasure he licked his hand clean of his mate's release then kissed Sholto's eyes, nose and cheeks before mating their mouths. As the kiss ended, Sholto sighed in contentment and then scowled. The scowl was completely ineffectual given his post-orgasmic flushed appearance. His face radiated joy rather than censure.</p>, <p>"I should be really angry with you," he said tapping Uist's nose with a forefinger. "I'm meant to be on duty, not letting my husband ravish me on the command deck."</p>, <p>Uist's happy sky blue eyes locked with his lover's deeper oceanic orbs and his smiled shyly.</p>, <p>"I missed you," he offered quietly. "AI was more than capable of scanning for Tristam and I missed you."</p>, <p>"I missed you, too, love," Sholto hastened to assure his husband cuddling closer to the imposing bulk of the bigger man. "But Rayner needed us last night and I knew once we were finally sleeping you would stay awake to ensure Rayner stayed asleep until deeply sleeping. I thought I would let you sleep in."</p>, <p>"I would rather lose sleep than time with you, mine. Your presence is the first thing I seek on waking and the last thing I gaze upon before sleep."</p>, <p>"Love you so much, my husband" Sholto murmured as he sought out one of his mate's large nipples, suckling contentedly on the thick nub. With his left hand he sought out its twin and gently pinched the fleshy nub in harmony with the suckling of its twin.</p>, <p>Uist demonstrated his appreciation with a low rumbling purr. His hand slipped between Sholto's thighs gently caressing and fondling his spouse's lax genitals. He was content to allow arousal to build more slowly this time and to savour it as it grew between them. He knew Sholto would still be sensitive from his previous climax and he didn't want the younger man to experience any discomfort during their intimate times. Minutes passed and Sholto was soon arching into Uist's hand desperate for a harder touch.</p>, <p><br/>"Need you, my own," Uist said roughly, the sight and scent of his aroused mate tearing at the fragile control he had.</p>, <p>"Take me," Sholto begged softly.</p>, <p>Moving swiftly, Uist lifted Sholto to lay him back on the command chair, flipping a switch that allowed the chair to recline almost flat. He hitched Sholto's thighs over the curved, cushioned arms and gazed with barely contained hunger at the smaller man to wantonly displayed to him. He ensured Sholto's hips were at the edge of the chair and pulled the taut buttocks apart and sheathed himself in the already slick passage. He balanced his upper weight on his arms either side of Sholto's head and began to pump the smaller man's erection in time with the pistoning of his hips. He nipped, licked and kissed Sholto's neck and throat as the slighter man bared his throat for his mate's teeth. As Sholto writhed beneath him, Uist bit down at the juncture of neck and shoulder to raise a mark of his passion and possession. Sholto moaned his approval and Uist felt the tightening of the beloved body that heralded his mate's imminent release. Uist pounded harder hitting Sholto's sweet spot repeatedly, his lover crying out with pleasure, hands fisted in Uist's hair rhythmically clenching and unclenching with Uist's thrusts. With a scream of Uist's name, Sholto arched as best he could under his bigger mate and a stream of pearlescent fluid hit their chests. Uist's roar was seconds later as he was milked by his mate's contracting channel, filling the smaller body once again with his seed.</p>, <p>As Uist tried to regulate his breath, he was aware that Sholto had passed out. He let himself slip from the haven of Sholto's body and proceeded to lick his mate clean. With a low growl of dark pleasure he lapped delicately at the stretched portal to taste the earthy musk of his mate overlaid with his own seed. Standing, he gazed with an indulgent smile at the boneless body and scooped the insensate form to cradle Sholto to his chest and await the smaller man's awakening. He was aware of the small movements as his mate began to awaken. Unconsciously Sholto pressed into the comfort and warmth of Uist's body. As he became more aware he gazed up at his husband. Sky and ocean met, bridged by love.</p>, <p>"Love you, mine," Uist rumbled possessively, tenderly stroking sweat-damp hair away from the beautiful face.</p>, <p>"Love you, my husband," Sholto replied, burying himself deeper into Uist's embrace.</p>, <p>The two men sat entwined, unconcerned about their nudity. The temperature was comfortable and after two explosive climaxes, Sholto was more asleep than awake held safe and content wrapped in his mates arms and love.</p>, <p>"Incoming message from Tristam to Silver Star," the voice of AI encroached into Sholto's drifting mind and unthinkingly, the young man started to his feet as the display screen shifted from star-dusted space to show the imposing figure of a strikingly handsome man.</p>, <p>Dark blond hair reached to broad shoulders and his eyes were a blue-grey of stormy skies. There was a small cleft in his chin that added to rather than distracted from his appearance. Although only visible to just below his shoulders, he emanated physical power and presence.</p>, <p>"Tristam," Sholto cried aloud with delight. "You made it back early"</p>, <p>"Indeed," the older man agreed with a slight smile. "Did I arrive too early?" His smile widened into a full grin at the blank look from the nude young man. Sholto only understood the inference as Uist came to stand at his side, a large hand draping across his genitals, another pulling him to the bigger body. Sholto felt the blush start at his toes and suffuse his whole body, leaving his face a glowing pink.</p>, <p>"Uist, my friend, your mate glows with health."</p>, <p>"Indeed," Uist agreed with his own smile. "And it is always my pleasure to have him thus."</p>, <p>Sholto groaned and buried his face against Uist's bulk as the older man laughed easily.</p>, <p>"AI can see me safely docked..." Tristam began, unwilling to keep his friends and fellow crewmen from being together.</p>, <p>"We will wait till you are aboard. It is no hardship for us," Uist assured.</p>, <p>Tristam nodded, knowing he could rely on the cat-like male to speak truthfully to him.</p>, <p>"Rayner?" Tristam asked, his face turning anxious.</p>, <p>"He had a bad night last night, but stayed with us. He needed occasional soothing but then slept well. He has coped." Uist replied.</p>, <p>"Thank you, my friend," Tristam said, the sentiment heartfelt.</p>, <p>"I am the Protector of your mate as you are to mine. Even so, I would gladly guard his sleep as he is beloved to my mate and myself."</p>, <p>Tristam nodded, no words necessary.</p>, <p>"Just don't make a habit of leaving him," Sholto's muffled voice came from the vicinity of Uist's chest. "He does miss you terribly when he can't feel you."</p>, <p>"I miss him too," Tristam confirmed quietly. "You have my promise."</p>, <p>As Tristam made his way to the quarters he shared with his younger spouse, he thought of how their lives had started so badly and yet had led to their meeting. Tristam knew Rayner was the other part of his soul. Each man complimented and completed the other, to the point they shared a psychic bond that left Rayner distressed and himself desolate when they were apart and unable to 'feel' each other. In Tristam's case, his earliest memories were of a medical facility. His early memories wiped. He might have been intended as a sex slave, or a child for a childless couple. Instead his genes had been spliced. Some of the genetic material was that from PrideHome. He had been made to see and hear better than humans, better even than Uist. He was faster and stronger and was of above average intelligence, his mental abilities a par with his physical ones.</p>, <p>He had been rescued by Jameson Peters who at the time was the head of a special crime response team that covered not just earth, but allied worlds of the Planetary Federation. Something had 'clicked' when they had met and Jameson had used every ounce of his power, persuasion and that of his friends to ensure the seven year old Tristam was adopted into his family and not regarded as a freak to be exploited. Tristam had taken to both Jameson and his wife Aurora and had studied hard to repay their kindness and generosity. He watched as young children were often taken in on short term stays by the loving couple, but he was 'their' child.</p>, <p>When Tristam was fifteen, he had the single biggest life-changing event in his life. He had overheard Jameson talking to the chauffeur he used who was worried about a small boy that distant relatives of his wife had taken on. The boy had been orphaned and seemed to be having some problems dealing with the death and no-one wanted to give him the love and affection he would need. He was being passed around several, what the chauffeur considered, unsuitable couples and he feared for the boy. Smiling to himself, Tristam prepared himself to have another small child around. He wasn't prepared for the reaction on seeing that same small boy.</p>, <p>The boy was five or six at Tristam's evaluation as he saw the small bundle in his Papa's arms. Dark curly hair peeped out over the blanket in which he was wrapped. One arm was visible and Tristam felt anger welling up at the thinness of the limb. The skin looked dull, but Tristam was sure it would normally be a honey-tint. He felt a pull towards the child and found his arms reaching to take him from Papa's arms. At the same time the child turned and turned pain-filled sorrowful deep brown eyes upon the older boy. Tristam felt as though an empty part of his soul had been filled and tears sprang to his eyes as the boy reached for him. As he took the precious bundle, Tristam vowed he would die before he allowed harm to befall the child again. Extending his hearing as he spirited the boy away, he distantly heard Papa call him Rayner.</p>, <p>He washed the thin body and dressed Rayner in one of his own T-shirts. Mama had brought some milk and sandwiches and Tristam had sat with Rayner in his arms as the small child had eaten and drunk. Once the food had gone, Rayner had reached to hug Tristam and fallen asleep in the older boy's arms. He had taken Rayner to his bed and slept curled around the thin body. At some point he was aware of his parents entering the room. Recognising them, Tristam simply cuddled closer to Rayner and allowed sleep to claim him again as he heard Mama's voice.</p>, <p>"I think Tristam's found his soul-mate. It looks like we have two sons now."</p>, <p>Years had flown by and Tristam had never tried to lead his 'younger brother' into a relationship with him. They still shared a room together when Tristam was at home. It had been hard sometimes when he'd detected a quickening heartbeat or a surge of hormones scented with arousal from the younger boy when they were alone. But he determined that if their relationship were to deepen, Rayner needed to have made the decision for himself.<br/></p>]\n***\n[<p>It was the year before Rayner's majority that things finally changed. At the end of the night as the two young men sat in their room on the edge of their beds, facing each other, Tristam had thought back over the evening. Rayner had kissed many people of both sexes, but only Tristam's lips. He had danced with many, but had only melted into Tristam's arms, moulding his body to the older boy's during slow music. Tristam gazed into the deep brown eyes he knew so well and saw the love and desire he'd always sought gazing back at him. He'd slid to Rayner's bed and they had shred their first kiss of passion. Tristam's hand had unthinkingly sought the heat at Rayner's groin and as the kiss deepened, he had squeezed virgin flesh rhythmically until Rayner had shuddered his first release. Tristam had immediately tried to apologise, but Rayner had reassured the older boy. They did, however, determine that they would not go beyond mutual touching with their hands until Rayner was considered adult. They loved each other too much to risk any reprisals. Tristam had promised that if Rayner still felt the same way on his birthday, they would declare their relationship openly and perhaps a year later they could announce an engagement with a wedding after Rayner's graduation. However, life was to interfere with his perfect plans.</p>, <p>Tristam had become a member of their Papa's Elite team the year the two young men had declared their love for each other. There had been no problems as the year sped by and both were looking forward to Rayner's coming of age. However, three day's before Rayner's birthday, Tristam had disappeared. He had been betrayed by a contact in the case and now lay bruised and beaten in the hold of a ship. Rayner had become frantic, feeling Tristam's pain, but not able to locate the man he loved. From the day they had declared their love, a psychic link had embedded between them and Rayner had delighted in being able to 'feel' Tristam when he got closer to home and had been trying to extend the distance.</p>, <p>Rayner had refused to eat or drink trying to focus on finding Tristam. Their Mama had worried that if Tristam were lost to them, they would also lose their younger son. She had sat with Rayner trying to make sense of what he felt. When he had said that he felt their link was stretching upward, Aurora had gone to her husband with nothing more than Rayner's feeling and her own instincts and asked him to have all spaceships leaving the locality be checked. It turned out to be enough. The rest of Tristam's team had their suspicions about a freighter and had engaged it. Both ships had suffered heavy damage, including communications failure. However, after rescuing Tristam, they had continued with their mission, Tristam feeling something wrong with Rayner, but no knowing the younger's man's heath was deteriorating rapidly. At the successful conclusion of the mission, Tristam had hastened to get home having been gone five days.</p>, <p>He had contacted Papa at the first opportunity and had been told to come home without delay. Papa's voice sending chills down his spine. As he'd got closer to home, his link with Rayner hadn't strengthened. All he felt was desolation and pain and the knowledge that Rayner was slipping away, believing Tristam dead. He couldn't break through to reassure the younger man he was there. Words hadn't been needed as he had raced past his parents at the door of their room. He had been focused on the beloved heartbeat that sounded do weak and the scent that was tainted with sickness and near-death. He wailed his pain aloud at the sight of the pale, gaunt figure that lay in his bed. Dark shadows were beneath Rayner's eyes and his face was pinched in pain. Without hesitation he had thrown off his clothes and slid into bed to wrap himself around the fragile form as though he could imbue Rayner with his own strength. Their parents had left them alone knowing that if Tristam couldn't bring Rayner back then none could.</p>, <p>For hours Tristam had touched and kissed and talked to Rayner. He had managed to get the smaller man to drink by taking mouthfuls of water himself and pressing the liquid into Rayner's mouth in a parody of a kiss. The younger man seemed to be gaining some awareness and Tristam was prepared to talk himself hoarse if need be.</p>, <p>Finally Tristam had felt an almost hesitant squeeze to his hand and slowly two exhausted brown eyes had opened to peer at him.</p>, <p>&gt;Dream?&lt; he'd heard in a raspy whisper.</p>, <p>&gt;No dream&lt; he'd assured. He had felt tendrils in his mind and knew Rayner was strengthening their bond, opening himself to his soul-mate. Tristam had wept openly when experiencing Rayner's feelings. He knew now he couldn't live without this man as his mate at his side.</p>, <p>Tristam hadn't left Rayner's side whilst the younger man recovered. They had announced their engagement at Rayner's deferred party and one year later, they had married. Whilst Rayner had completed his University education, Tristam had taken up a teaching post and it was here they had met the other members of Tristam's personal elite. They had also enlisted the assistance of telepaths in regards their link. Now they could endure the separation but, for Rayner in particular, they were always distressing to a greater or lesser degree.</p>, <p>Tristam's reverie had taken him form the docking bay to the quarters he shared with the man he loved. He opened the door silently and gazed at the slumbering form in their bed.</p>, <p>Rayner was obviously restless, the thin sheet tangled around long, smooth limbs, leaving him naked to Tristam's gaze. If he had been considered beautiful as a child, in Tristam's eyes, Rayner as an adult was striking in his beauty. Dark hair fell in curls to his shoulders. The deep brown eyes that could be like pools of molten chocolate when filled with love or glitter like jet when aroused were closed. The Cupid 's bow lips were slightly parted and a pink tongue flickered out briefly to wet them. Rayner's skin had indeed been honey-toned and as Tristam's eyes raked across the naked form, the dark discs of Rayner's nipples beckoned. Then with a moan, the younger man spread his legs and Tristam stared hungrily at the dark hair at Rayner's groin and the smooth, slender flesh that lay flaccid.</p>, <p>With a feral smile, Tristam mounted the bed and settled between the outspread thighs, sucking the slender shaft into his mouth as he parted the smooth thighs further apart. He revelled in the unique flavour of his lover's musk as he released the thickening organ to lap at the hairless testicles. Taking the almost fully aroused shaft back into his mouth, Tristam began to apply more suction as Rayner began to unconsciously respond to the erotic assault.</p>, <p>Rayner's sleep had been troubled since his husband left "Silver Star". He understood and appreciated he couldn't accompany his mate and knew there was little likelihood of any danger to the man he loved, but when he couldn't feel Tristam, he felt desolate, cast adrift. He friends, his family on "Silver Star", and the men that were as close as and more beloved than if they were blood relatives helped as best they could. Without them he wasn't sure he could cope with the separations as well as he did, although even he had to admit he was improving.</p>, <p>His dreams had been strangely empty during Tristam's absence. He had even taken up Sholto's offer of sharing the room with him and Uist and had slept well that night, but dreamlessly. Now his dream was strangely erotic. He felt no fear or threat. Instead, he felt his shaft had been enveloped in warm, wet heat. He felt safe and loved and was becoming increasingly aroused. He breathed a soft moan of pleasure as he felt added suction and reached between his thighs to his dream lover. With a start he realised his lover was no dream. His eyes flew open. The sight of his mate between his spread legs, sucking on his aroused flesh was too much for the younger man and with a cry of Tristam's name he climaxed hard, his head falling back to his pillow as he rode out the waves of released passion.</p>, <p>As Rayner's orgasm ended, Tristam suckled the softening organ to ensure he had devoured all his spouse's sexual surrender before releasing it to climb astride the boneless body and share a Rayner-flavoured kiss with his much missed other half. He was pleased that Rayner responded so enthusiastically, wrapping arms and legs around the bigger man. He allowed his weight to settle carefully on the slender body beneath him. Trying to balance the need he knew Rayner had to feel his weight and yet not crush the smaller man. He settled joyfully between the parted thighs.</p>, <p>"I love..."</p>, <p>"...love you." The men spoke in concert and smiled at each other, revelling in the physical and mental bond. </p>, <p>"I missed you," Rayner said softly as he tenderly caressed the cleft in his lover's chin.</p>, <p>"I missed you, Angel" Tristam affirmed.</p>, <p>"Will you love me?" Rayner asked anxiously. "I want to feel you inside me, making us one."</p>, <p>"Shh, love," Tristan soothed, feeling the younger man's need through their bond. "I want that, too. To not know where one of us ends and the other begins. I want to feel you when you contract around me in pleasure and I want to feel my seed filling you." The older male punctuated his words with passionate kisses as he retrieved the lube from their bedside locker. He kissed his way down Rayner's body to suck greedily at each of the dark brown discs in the centre of each sensitive breast. Rayner mewled in pleasure arching into his mate's touch. As Tristam sucked, he teased the sensitive flesh of Rayner's most intimate entrance before slowly sliding as well lubricated finger inside. As he pressed a second finger into the slender channel, Tristam nibbled around Rayner's navel, occasionally thrusting his tongue inside in imitation of another more intimate act to follow. Rayner moaned, reaching to stroke any part of his lover's skin he could reach. His touches ignited Tristam's passion and the bigger man's breathing became harsher as he struggled to ensure his lover was adequately stretched and slick before plunging into his heated depths. As his third finger slid inside, Rayner began thrusting his hips, impaling himself on his mate's fingers. Tristam sucked at the resurgent erection, ensuring Rayner was as close as he was and then guided the long, slender limbs around his waist.</p>, <p>"Need you inside me," Rayner begged. "Please."</p>, <p>Tristam lined up his impressive length to his mate's glistening portal.</p>, <p>"Love you, Angel," he groaned as he pressed forward into tight, slick heat. Rayner's slender channel clasped his length from root to tip and as he slid fully home both men moaned their joy.</p>, <p>Tristam waited for Rayner to indicate he was ready for the bigger man to move and then began a powerful rhythmic thrusting. He angled himself to brush Rayner's hidden jewel with every movement and the younger man cried out and writhed in ecstasy. Tristam stroked Rayner's erection, knowing they wouldn't last long having been away from each other. All too soon and not soon enough, Rayner arched crying Tristam's name as his seed flowed a second time. A second later, Tristam's voice joined his as he released his seed deep into the willing body. As their climaxes ended, Tristam heard Rayner's plea:</p>, <p>"Don't pull out yet."</p>, <p>"I won't sweetheart." Instead, the bigger man rolled them carefully to drape an exhausted but elated Rayner over his larger body whilst staying buried in the safe haven of Rayner's body. He smiled as Rayner nuzzled into the juncture of neck and shoulder, inhaling the scent of his bigger mate. Tristam began to massage the back of Rayner's head wanting his young lover to relax into the sleep he needed.</p>, <p>"Love you," Rayner whispered sleepily. Tristan kissed the curly-topped head and nuzzled at Rayner's temple, lapping at the dampness.</p>, <p>"Love you, baby. Sleep now, my love."</p>, <p>For a while Tristam was content to hold his precious lover and listen to the contented snuffling that came with Rayner's descent into sleep and then allowed himself to join him. </p>, <p>The ship alerted the sleeping men that it was time to rise. Smiling, they tenderly kissed before moving to share a shower. As Tristam ran his soaped hands over Rayner's lithe form, another more basic need than cleansing came to the fore. Guiding the smaller man to brace his arms against the shower wall, Tristam used his soapy fingers to prepare the slender channel, proceeding cautiously in case his young lover was sore from their earlier love-making. Although still a little tender, Rayner wanted this and conveyed his need to the older male. Tristam finished his preparations and slowly entered the tight passage. For a few moments the two men simply relished the feeling of being as one in body as they were in mind and spirit. Slowly Tristam began to rock in and out of Rayner's heat. With one hand he teased Rayner's dark cinnamon buds, with the other, the slender shaft arching gracefully to the younger male's abdomen. Rayner's pleasured moans were music to Tristam's ears. With jubilant cries they found their simultaneous release. Tristam ensured all traces of soap were removed and they dressed amidst kisses and caresses designed to show the depth of their mutual love rather than re-arouse.</p>, <p>Four faces turned to meet them as they entered the dining area, Tristam's arm proprietarily around Rayner's waist.</p>, <p>"Welcome, Tristam," Uist smiled broadly. "It would seem that this morning it is your mate that glows with health."</p>, <p>At Rayner's puzzled look and Sholto's crimson blush, the two older males laughed aloud.</p>, <p>"It would seem the adults have been playing whilst we children were innocently sleeping," Theophilus' melodic voice said in an amused tone. The young-looking male stood at a little less than six feet tall, but the graceful antennae above blond, winged eyebrows added another six inches. Silver-blond hair cascaded to waist level and was secured behind elegantly pointed ears. He was slender, almost ethereal and fragile looking but had a strength that belied appearances. His eyes were golden, his skin pale. His antennae acted as a form of smell and his hearing was excellent. He was of a race blessed with longevity and although in the first third of his second century, was in effect the youngest member of the team in terms of maturity.</p>, <p>"As ship's physician, perhaps I should be concerned at the hot flushes that seem to be affecting Sholto," came from the last of the crew. </p>, <p>Xavier was reptilian. He stood at over six and a half feet tall, with smooth, pale green skin. His snout extended by six inches and ended with thick, rubbery lips, hiding a set of strong, sharp teeth and a thick, forked tongue. A frill decorated his neck around the back, which could rise or fall and change colour depending on the reptilian's moods. His hands were long and slender, as were his fingers. His powerful thighs were bulky against the material that covered them and although not the fastest runner, was able to keep running beyond the abilities of his mammalian family. His long tail ended thinly and was useful as a weapon as well as having other uses. He slid his arm around Theophilus' waist and the younger male gazed adoringly at his life-mate. Xavier's species was also long-lived. He was just beginning the last third of his second century, but due to the fast mental and physical maturity of his race, was effectively the oldest of the team.</p>, <p>"It's nothing, guys," Sholto assured unsuccessfully as another round of gentle laughter came from the two older mammalian males.</p>, <p>Tristam came to stand by Uist, who was the second-in-command in his absence. As a PrideHome Warrior, that meant there were certain rituals to follow on Tristam's return. The two Alpha males gently bumped their foreheads together. Then Tristam rubbed his head against Uist and Uist tilted his neck, offering his throat as a submissive gesture to show acceptance of Tristam's standing as absolute Alpha on the ship. Tristam nuzzled the fragile flesh, but did not mark it. The two men then embraced and Tristam kissed Uist on each cheek before moving to Sholto. </p>, <p>Tristam smiled gently as Sholto's submissive gesture of baring his throat mirrored his mate's perfectly. Again, Tristam simply nuzzled, then kissed Sholto gently, rubbing his knuckles over Sholto's cheek. Moving to Theophilus, the men embraced, their hands dancing gently up and down each other's backs before Tristam kissed the delicate blond beauty. Finally, he rubbed his face against Xavier's snout as the two males gripped each other's wrists. Once the formal greetings were concluded, Tristam then guided his own mate to the group. Reversing Tristam's order, Rayner kissed Xavier, Theophilus and Sholto before standing before Uist and tilting his head as Uist and Sholto had before Tristam. Uist nuzzled the honeyed skin before rubbing his knuckles against Rayner's cheek as they kissed in an identical gesture as Tristam had used to Uist's own mate. The group then began laughing and chatting as they moved around to begin their first meal of the day.</p>, <p>As the meal concluded, Uist noticed the increasing anxiety of his younger spouse. He knew it wouldn't be from the earlier teasing and was also aware that the other man had received a couple of communications from an old friend that seemed to have played on his mind. But before the bigger male could act, Sholto gave a nervous cough and, glancing nervously from his husband to his commander and Protector, asked:</p>, <p>"Do we have anything imminent or do we have some days of free time?"</p>, <p>"There is nothing awaiting our immediate attention," Tristam replied carefully. Although his sense of scent hadn't been recorded as enhanced, it was more acute than most human's and with Uist's tutelage was almost at PrideHome levels and he could scent Sholto's rising nervousness. He took in the flaring of Uist's nostrils and the immediate protective attitude of the cat-man. "Is there something you want to do?"</p>, <p>"I've had a couple of calls from Jonas. He's been settled for a while now and is always asking for not just me, but all of us to go visit. I haven't seen him since...since Uni when...when he was on secondment...when...when..."</p>, <p>Five concerned faces looked at the young man as he struggled and failed to maintain the façade of calm. Uist pulled him unresistingly onto his lap and no-one commented when his face buried itself into the bigger male's shoulder. Sholto was happy to let the scent and warmth keep him safe.</p>, <p>"If you would like to visit then I'm sure I speak for all of us that we would be happy to accompany you."</p>, <p>There was a general murmur of assent and a short silence as Sholto's answer was awaited.</p>, <p>"He says there'll be a lot of thick snow just now. Perfect for all kinds of Winter sports." The voice held a little more confidence for all it was slightly muffled from Uist's bulk.</p>, <p>"Then tell him the answer from all of us is 'yes'" Tristam said coming to stroke the smaller man's auburn curls. He dropped his head to kiss the top of Sholto's head and nodded towards the door at Uist. In response the other male swept Sholto into his arms and strode from the room, leaving four men to remember the events that had led to Uist and Sholto's marriage and the forming of the team and family they were today.</p>, <p>Sholto and Rayner were two years apart in age with Sholto the older. However, they had become instant friends and shared many classes and Rayner was advanced in his linguistics and they thought that with Sholto's own advanced positioning cultural anthropology, they would probably graduate together. Uist, like Tristam, was at the University as a teacher. He was teaching a year's course in military strategy and was a superb strategist and gave some self-defence classes privately. Rayner and Tristam had quickly noticed the attraction between the denizen of PrideHome and Sholto and had often arranged for the four of them to meet and give the other two men time to get to know each other. Occasionally leaving the two alone in their married quarters to give them somewhere safe and secure to develop their budding romance. Uist had confessed some concerns to Tristam regarding Sholto's youthfulness and virginity. In response, Tristam had told Uist of his and Rayner's relationship and how he had almost lost the younger man before they had even begun to live their lives. <br/></p>]\n***\n[<p><b>Silver 2: Smoke and Mirrors</b></p>, <p>Eyes followed and heads turned in a mixture of admiration and lust as the stunning blond strode purposefully through the white sterile environment. Glances and murmured comments were ignored equally, nothing interfering with the sole focus of navigating their way through the indoor maze, which they were finding claustrophobic. The blond's long slender legs were encased in tight, green leather pants with a darker green tunic that barely skimmed their hips. The blond's long hair was secured behind elegantly pointed ears, cascading like a golden waterfall to the slim waist. The vision was both beautiful and ethereal. With a sigh of relief they finally stood outside a laboratory door. Golden eyes perused the signs of Private, No Admittance and Plague Control. A pink tongue lapped nervously at delicate lips. With a fortifying breath the blond rapped at the door and stepped inside.</p>, <p>The reptilian scientist looked up, surprised by the intrusion. No one except the overall scientist in control of the medical complex sought him out and then only after contacting him in advance. Although his medical expertise was desperately needed by the planet, many in the complex had a deep-rooted dislike of off-worlders; especially those whose appearance differed greatly from their own humanoid form. Although the world was trying to integrate with the myriad of other planets and peoples beyond their solar system, xenophobia was still ingrained in many.</p>, <p>The lizard man was tall and muscular, the baggy lab coat doing nothing to disguise the bulk and power of the male. His lips curled back over strong, sharp teeth and the frill around his neck changed from the varying hues of green to a pale lilac. His tail swished behind him as he recognised the form standing anxiously in the open doorway. He held out large, sensitive hands.</p>, <p>"Beautiful," he whispered.</p>, <p>"Husband." The blond responded and hurried to be caught in a strong embrace before being swung around in evident joy.</p>, <p>The forked reptilian tongue flicked over the blond's mouth as the pink lips parted to invite a more intimate caress. A deep musical trill permeated the air indicating the pleasure of the reptilian holding the striking blond mammal. As he lowered the slender form to the floor, he felt the arousal at the blond's groin and palmed the bulge possessively.</p>, <p>"I have missed you, my heart," the lizard murmured, nuzzling into sweet smelling blond tresses. "Are you sure it is safe for you to be here?" he added anxiously, pulling back to gaze at the golden eyes.</p>, <p>"The all clear was announced an hour ago. Do you think Tristam would have allowed me to leave Silver Star to be here if unsafe, irrespective of how my soul cried for you?" the blond smiled reassuringly.</p>, <p>"Beloved," the lizard crooned. It was hardly surprising he hadn't been notified, but there were more important matters to attend to now. His hand caressed his mate's need.</p>, <p>"I desire you, Xavier," the man in his arms pleaded. "I love you."</p>, <p>And I love you, Theophilus," the reptilian replied. "I have a nest through here," he indicated an inner room. "Let me lock the outer door."</p>, <p>Xavier then ushered his slighter mate into the small room that had been his living quarters for the last four days. It contained a nest of thin, old cushions, a large chair and a small table. He heard the distressed sound from his beautiful lover. "Comfort was not a consideration," he said nuzzling and caressing. "But that matters naught now you are in my arms."</p>, <p>Theophilus pulled free and disrobed with what he considered indecent haste, but he longed to once again be joined with the one he loved. He quickly lay in Xavier's nest and gazed adoringly up at the dominant male.</p>, <p>Xavier's breath caught as the light of the dim lamp made Theophilus' skin glow with a golden hue. The slender, hairless limbs were as a siren song to the lizard. He devoured the sight of his beloved: naked, willing, open; in *his* nest. *His* mate. Xavier's trill dropped so low as to resemble a growl as he roughly removed the clothes he wore, throwing them carelessly aside. He then stood looming over the slender, supine form. He watched as arms and legs opened in silent, but unmistakable invitation.</p>, <p>"Please," Theophilus' melodic voice caressed Xavier's aural depressions. One single word that was both a plea and a command Xavier could not nor would not refuse. He displayed his teeth in his unique smile again as he dropped to blanket the younger man. Deceptively strong arms and legs wrapped around his shoulders and hips drawing him unresistingly closer and his tongue flicked beyond the willingly parted lips to the warm wet cavern beyond. Xavier reacquainted himself with his mate's sweetness before reluctantly withdrawing.</p>, <p>"I have missed you so, my husband," Theophilus panted. He pressed soft kisses to pale green, smooth skin.</p>, <p>"I could not chance any of my family contacting this plague," Xavier groaned. "Much less you, my beloved mate. My constitution ensured my immunity, but one I could not share with you. It has indeed been a long lonely time without your presence."</p>, <p>The reptilian shifted so his tongue could flicker over his mate's pink nipples, the perfect nubs pebbling instantly. Strong teeth bit down on the peaks with expert precision to ensure mounting arousal, his mate's breasts were highly sensitive and an erogenous zone for both males. He licked lower, tasting the smooth skin of abdomen and hips before the long, agile muscle wrapped around the base of his husband's smooth, slender arousal. He felt the blond buck with a sweet cry of pleasure as his tongue laved the engorged head greedily swallowing the pearly pre-come. His large hands slid under smooth toned buttocks, lifting upwards and outwards to display his mate's tiny pink portal.</p>, <p>Theophilus arched crying his pleasure aloud as his mate licked his opening. The reptilian tongue pressed inside his tightly furled aperture to taste the blond's natural lubricant. Theophilus knew his lover would prefer to assist dilation with the oil Xavier himself had created, and that all of their family used, but it hadn't occurred to him to bring any.</p>, <p>Xavier found the intimate taste combined with the pheromones his mate was producing were a potent aphrodisiac. He needed to mate, to claim that which was his and his alone.</p>, <p>"Love you, Beautiful," he whispered.</p>, <p>"Want you so much, my husband," Theophilus groaned.</p>, <p>The bigger male moved to lie at his young husband's side. His tongue wrapped around Theophilus' erection and began a combination of rhythmic contractions and stroking. The rough surface of the reptilian tongue provided an extra stimulation to further inflame the blond's arousal. Xavier slid his tail between spread thighs and allowed it to penetrate the writhing younger male. As it slipped inside, Xavier wound it into a corkscrew to ensure Theophilus was stretched to accept his twin penises. He made small thrusting motions with his tail, further encouraging Theophilus' natural lubricant to coat the slender channel. With expertise, Xavier timed gentle tugs to taut teats with the forked tip of his tongue laving the head of Theophilus' penis and the tip of his tail rubbing the hidden jewel deep in the blond's body.</p>, <p>The triple stimulation was too much for him and Theophilus' came as he cried his husband's name.</p>, <p>Xavier's snout covered the fragile flesh and the reptilian felt the pulses of his mate's release hit the back of his tongue. He was exceptionally careful to protect his mammalian lover from his sharp teeth. Only when Theophilus sagged spent, did Xavier release the sated organ and swallow its warm salty essence. His tail continued to pulse within Theophilus' boneless body as Xavier repositioned himself between his lover's widespread legs. He hooked slender limbs over his arms, spreading the smaller male open wide. His twin hemipenes unsheathed from inside his body, slick with lubricant as his tail withdrew from moist heat. Xavier heard his lover's moan at the sight of the glistening organs. It was a measure of Xavier's arousal that both penises had unsheathed. His young husband could accommodate both simultaneously, but would be fully filled during their love-making.</p>, <p>The soft mewls of pleasure from the slender male beneath him were as music to the reptilian. He slid effortlessly inside the prepared channel and began to stroke rhythmically; ensuring Theophilus' sweet spot was stimulated constantly. The lizard's tongue flicked over throat, collarbone and as far down as the peaked, pink nipples whilst his tail sinuously slid against Theophilus' sensitive hairless sac. The smaller man's hips moved in perfect harmony with his mate, his own satiated rod reawakening, trapped between their undulating bodies. Xavier knew they were both approaching their peak and his hemipenes produced their knot, completely plugging his husband's slender channel.</p>, <p>Theophilus groaned as he felt the stretch of his internal muscles from the forming knot. He panted shallowly as tendrils of pleasure began to bloom outwards from deep in his groin, radiating wave after wave throughout his whole body. A sharp nip to an already hypersensitive bud coinciding with his mate's hand on his primed shaft had Theophilus arching and crying Xavier's name as his essence flowed a second time between their bodies.</p>, <p>The contractions around his already eager organs and the combined scent and sight of his mate in sexual ecstasy finally fractured the reptilian's control. Pulse after pulse of his hot seed filled his mate, till both organs were fully spent. As he recovered from his orgasmic high, the bigger male rolled their still joined bodies to allow his lissom mate to drape voluptuously over his now sated body. The lizard sighed in absolute pleasure.</p>, <p>"Stay in me for a while longer," Theophilus' soft melodic voice begged.</p>, <p>"It would be my pleasure, my heart," Xavier replied. He gave a mental frown as he regarded the beloved visage. In his joyful reunion he had not noticed the dark smudges beneath his mate's eyes and the tiny lines around them that told of nights without sleep and the consequential headaches. He began to massage the back of his lover's head, knowing it would relax the younger man. He smiled as Theophilus' weight settled more heavily, the already satiated body relaxing further under the tender ministrations.</p>, <p>"Sleep in my arms, my love," Xavier crooned softly.</p>, <p>"Love," came as a reply on a soft breath as Theophilus sank into the first real sleep since Xavier had left the haven of Silver Star.</p>, <p>Xavier allowed his knot to dissipate and re-sheathed his organs. His tail wrapped around the blond male holding the smaller man close to his body, lovingly and protectively. Soon, Xavier slid into his own deep sleep.</p>, <p>*****</p>, <p>An insistent bleep awakened the reptilian. He was pleased to note it hadn't disturbed his exhausted mate. Gently he untangled their limbs and went to answer the call. He listened, replied and returned to the slowly stirring beauty in his nest. Crouching next to the supine form, Xavier shamelessly began to massage the back of Theophilus' head encouraging the smaller man to resume his sleep. He smiled as his tactic worked.</p>, <p>"Sleep a little longer, my love," he whispered. "When I return we can leave this inhospitable place."</p>, <p>"Take care," came the sleepy response.</p>, <p>Xavier dressed rapidly. The sooner he received the official confirmation he was no longer needed here, the sooner they could return to their ship and their family. In his haste, although Xavier closed the outer door, he failed to additionally lock it.</p>, <p>Theophilus became aware of being touched by hands he knew were those of strangers. With a rapid movement, he scuttled to sit clutching a sheet to his nude form. Leering at him were two men who were denizens of this world. The lascivious gazes had the blond fearing for his safety. He was unaware that in the comparative darkness neither the colour of his eyes, his slanting brows nor his small antenna were visible.</p>, <p>"You see, Byran," the larger of the two men hissed. "I told you the lizard had been provided with entertainment."</p>, <p>The speaker was large and swarthy with lank, dark hair and smelt unclean. Theophilus would have found him unattractive even if his eyes and face hadn't been filled with a mix of hate and lust.</p>, <p>"We have worked just as hard and for longer and have been denied such pleasures," the man continued.</p>, <p>Theophilus spared a glance at his companion. He was similarly swarthy, but with red hair. Although he was less physically repugnant, Theophilus still feared the lust in the hazel eyes.</p>, <p>"Please," the blond said quietly. "I am bonded to Xavier." He meant it to convey his status as married to the reptilian, but he could see it wasn't understood. Before he could try and explain further, a strong hand latched around his ankle to pull him closer to the two men.</p>, <p>"I don't care what fancy name you give it, whore," the dark man growled. "I've been cooped up here over a week with no means of relieving tension or being able to have the pleasures a body like yours can provide. I want what you gave the lizard."</p>, <p>Realising their intent, Theophilus made a small movement as though capitulating to his aggressors. As the men leaned eagerly forward, Theophilus lashed out with two balled fists to send both men tumbling backwards. He surged to his feet preferring not to fight naked, unarmed and outnumbered. Clutching desperately to the sheet, he flew to the outer door. He reached for the handle as a bolt of pain, that began in his spine and radiated outwards to envelop his entire body, struck him soundlessly. His body dropped instantly, twitching spasmodically. With mounting fear, the blond realised that, whilst his mind was still clear, his body was unable to respond to his frantic commands to run or fight. A terrified whimper escaped from frozen lips as booted feet came into his line of vision.</p>, <p>"Stupid slut," the dark man huffed. "The effects are only temporary," he added lifting Theophilus easily to drop him on the nearby lab bench. "You'll be able to enjoy us soon enough. Now let's see what we're getting."</p>, <p>Flicking on the lab lights, Theophilus' exotic form was clear to see. Byran caught the dark man's hand as he reached for a pale thigh. He looked with concern at the tears that leaked from golden eyes radiating fear.</p>, <p>Wait, Silaff," he advised. "Look at him. He's an off-worlder, too. He may not be a prostitute."</p>, <p>"What is he then?" Silaff asked impatiently.</p>, <p>"A companion, a concubine? Who knows the minds or customs of off-worlders? I have no desire to touch him. I thought we were to find one of our kind here."</p>, <p>"You can back off if you want," Silaff said harshly. "I'm hard. I don't care what he is. If he belongs to the lizard, so much the better. We don't need his kind here."</p>, <p>He reached to push Theophilus' legs apart when a roar of fury rent the air. Before Silaff could react to the sound he was pinned to the floor. A large male straddled his body. He had a mix of darker and lighter hair. Eyes that were like chips of ice bored into Silaff's. Retractable claws now dug into the fragile flesh of his throat. The male was large and powerful, strong and muscular and there was not an ounce of mercy Silaff could behold in the form. An acrid smell arose from his body as he lost bladder control and tiny whimpers of fear were all the sounds he could make as words as cold and deadly as the male that uttered them reached his ears.</p>, <p>"If you have defiled Theophilus I will tear out your worthless throat."</p>, <p>Xavier was already at his mate's side. His sensitive tongue flicked around the now shaking form as he scented the air. He could smell and taste his mate's fear, the remnants of his assailants' lust that had been superseded by their fear and the taste of their own earlier loving.</p>, <p>"We didn't," Byran said. He gazed at a form similar to the one pinning down Silaff. This male had sandy blond hair that reached to the shoulders and eyes that were the colour of a stormy ocean. The size and bulk of the males were almost identical. From the tilting of the blond head and the flare of the nostrils, Byran had the ridiculous notion the man was listening to his heartbeat as he was scenting him.</p>, <p>"I think this one speaks truthfully, Xavier," he said in a menacing voice.</p>, <p>"I can find no evidence of an ... assault, Tristam," the reptilian concurred. He wrapped his lab coat around Theophilus' shaking body. "The effect is already wearing off quickly, beloved," he assured softly. "You will be left unharmed."</p>, <p>"Uist and I can take these to the complex's supervisor," Tristam said as he watched the other powerful male effortlessly haul Silaff to his feet, claws still pricking at the man's throat.</p>, <p>"No, Tristam," Xavier replied. "I told Eldman repeatedly of the treatment I was subjected to and he brushed it off. I want to make a formal complaint of my treatment as well as that of my bonded mate. I would like to make it in your presence so that it is recorded into Federation annuls to be officially dealt with. Not just handled by some local officiate who will hide it or ignore it. I would be grateful if Uist could protect my mate in our absence."</p>, <p>Silaff was shoved roughly into Xavier's grasp and the muscular male pressed his face close.</p>, <p>"You will admit all, omitting nothing. If you attempt to play down in any way your vile assault I will seek retribution personally." He leant a little closer so that Silaff could feel his hot breath. "I promise you will regret it if I do." The cold hard voice left Silaff with no doubt of the big male's sincerity. He made the instant decision that prison on his homeworld was the best and the safest place to be.</p>, <p>Xavier quickly glanced at the other two members of his 'family'. Sholto had one arm protectively around Theophilus' shoulder, as did Rayner, helping the blond to be able to sit upright. Sholto's auburn curls were caught by the lights in the lab giving the impression of burnished metal. His ocean blue eyes were filled with concern and despite being the smallest of the group, his solid frame offered strength to the slender form he cradled. Rayner's curls were darker and his body slimmer, but the worry in his deep brown eyes matched that of Sholto's. Uist had come to stand protectively in front of the trio of younger men. Xavier knew Theophilus was as loved and safe almost as if he were to remain. He nodded at them before turning to leave with Tristam.</p>, <p>On returning to the lab, Xavier and Tristam stood silently contemplating the tableau before them. Uist had sat in the large chair with a dressed Theophilus in his lap. His head was tucked under Uist's chin and he was cradled by powerful arms. Sholto sat on one arm of the chair, his head on his husband's shoulder and one arm around Theophilus. Rayner was on the other. He, too, rested his head on Uist's shoulder and his arm grasped Sholto's as though they were forming a barrier to protect the slender blond. Both Tristam and Xavier scented the air. It was heavy with a familiar and heady scent and they realised that Uist had used his own musk to create an air of comfort and familiarity. The low rumbling purr the big male emitted was almost hypnotic in timbre. Xavier smiled at the efforts his family had made to comfort his mate. Neither he nor Tristam could scent any residual fear from the sleeping blond. There was only contentment and peace in the air. He saw Uist slit one eye open, but was sure the cat-man had known of their presence since they first re-entered the lab.</p>, <p>"Thank you, beloved brother," he said sincerely as Tristam's hand settled on his shoulder.</p>, <p>"Your mate is as beloved to me as Rayner," Uist said quietly. "As I am Protector of Rayner and as Tristam is Protector of Sholto, we both desire to be Protectors of Theophilus. We had hoped to make this offer before you were called away. We feel it is one that is long overdue. If you would grant us the honour?"<br/></p>]
