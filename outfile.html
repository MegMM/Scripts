<p>{title}</p>\n<p>by</>\n<p>{author}</p><p>The large male naked body padded as silently through the deserted corridors of the spaceship as would have been achieved in the savannahs or jungles of his homeworld. Nudity wasn't an issue. All the crew were male and the naked being knew where each one of them was at that time. That included the location of the one he now stalked. The male caught a glimpse of himself in a polished surface; a little over six feet tall, solid, muscular, powerful chest, thighs and upper arms only hinting of the real strength and power of the male. A mix of dark and slightly lighter hair reached to their shoulders. The two-tone hair also dusted their arms and legs, but his chest was hair free to display the muscles to best advantage. He flexed his large hands and checked his retractable claws and gave his image a feral smile to see strong, somewhat sharp, healthy teeth. His bright blue eyes appeared amber in the ship's muted light. When stalking prey, bright lights could hinder rather than help. The muted lighting was to his advantage.</p><p>Whether his intended victim was prepared to be a willing participant didn't register in the big male's mind. He needed to mate, to sheath his body in hot tight heat. He glanced down at the furred pouch at his groin. The engorged head of his sex was beginning to emerge. The pouch protected his genitals; keeping them hidden when naked as well as immobile should speed be necessary. However, at the moment anticipation was fuelling arousal. He growled an order to the ship's Artificial Intelligence. Stealth mode ensured doors opened silently and the male wanted to be as close as possible to his intended when he made his move. Many of his species enjoyed the extra stimulus of a prolonged chase before subduing their prey and under the right circumstances; it was pleasurable for him, too. However it was neither the place nor the time for such extra activities. Here, now a swift attack from a camouflaged approach would work best.</p><p>****</p><p>The young man was alone on the bridge of the spaceship. As far as he was aware only he and the ship's AI were on duty. There had been a message earlier and he expected the return of the ship's commander. If not for that ... there were more pleasurable pursuits than sitting watching space no matter how beautiful the sight. He sighed pushing away such thoughts. He had agreed to watch and wait - his decision. He pushed a slender hand through a riot of auburn hair that hung to his shoulders. Oceanic blue eyes held a hint of loneliness and a pink tongue flickered out across sensual lips before retreating. He turned his attention to the long range scanners. He could just have AI notify him when anything came in distance, but this gave him a focus.</p><p>Bending over the scanners, the young man was unaware of the doors opening and the large male entering the bridge. The bigger man stared with appreciation at the way the smaller man's skin-tight suit moulded itself to the taut buttocks. Without hesitation he strode forward and had enfolded his strong arm around the slighter man's waist lifting him easily, covering the mouth to muffle the cry of alarm.</p><p>"Want you," he growled into the nearest ear. "Want you now."</p><p>With a flourish, he spun the slighter form and as the dazed young man tried to bring his senses under control, pressed their lips together. He pushed his tongue inside the young man's mouth as he gasped and mapped the inside with proprietary arrogance. He used one hand to yank down the bodysuit's fastener to hip level and pull the material to mid-elbow, trapping the slighter man's arms.</p><p>"Uist, no," came the panting pleas as strong teeth latched onto a small brown nub peeking through a covering a luxurious chest hair. "No," the sound was little more than a moan as the neglected twin nub was pinched in concert with the teeth that worked on its mate. As teeth switched between nipples, nipping them to an aching pebbled hardness, the throbbing matched another in the young man's groin.</p><p>"You would not mate with me?" the bigger male asked, stroking the harness he knew he would find between splayed legs.</p><p>"I'm...on...duty" the smaller man gasped as his flesh was skilfully caressed.</p><p>"AI," Uist commanded." Advise us immediately when a craft comes within range and increase bridge ambient temperature to 90F"</p><p>"Confirmed," came the low female voice of the ship's AI.</p><p>"Now your duty is to me, your mate," Uist whispered in the young man's ear. With what sounded like a purr he rubbed his head against the smaller man's body as he quickly divested him of the offending bodysuit. Licking and nipping indiscriminatingly at any flesh within reach, the bigger man backed the smaller to the command chair before spinning so that he was seated with the smaller man in his lap. He then kissed the unresisting form deeply before arranging the young man to sit straddling his powerful thighs.</p><p>"You're insatiable," the smaller man huffed affectionately kissing the tip of the bigger man's nose.</p><p>"It has been a whole day," the reply was little short of a whine. "You had left our bed this morning when I awoke and I had duties offship the rest of the day."</p><p>"I'm sorry, lover," the smaller man said kissing the almost pouting lips.</p><p>"I would have you mate with me," Uist said, his voice dropping low and husky, the need and desire evident.</p><p>"I love you, Uist and I need for us to mate, too".</p><p>"Love you, Sholto, love you always. Share yourself with me. Let me make us one."</p><p>"Yes," Sholto breathed</p><p>In Uist's homeworld, a warrior like Uist was always the Alpha whether in a same or mixed sex marriage. The Warrior caste, like that of the Priest and Royal castes was a prestigious caste to be married into and carried ceremonial responsibilities. Uist never subjugated his young human spouse. Sholto's intelligence and individuality had been a major part of the attraction. That he was as beautiful outside as inside was a bonus for the cat-man. Some on his world preferred their mate to be displayed as little more than a trophy if marrying into an exalted caste. Uist liked to show that in many ways, Sholto was his equal. On those ceremonial occasions where it was necessary, however, Sholto behaved impeccably complying unhesitatingly with all that was required of him. PrideHome had therefore welcomed the young human. Sholto had assured his mate that he considered himself privileged to have Uist as his husband and to occasionally have to demonstrably be Uist's Beta was a small price to pay for the happiness they shared. Outside of PrideHome, however, whilst the two men regarded each other as equals, there was no doubting that Uist was sexually dominant and Sholto was more than happy with the that situation. He loved his mate's dominance in bed.</p><p>"Show me you love me with your body, Uist," he begged softly. Words fled the smaller man as large hands began to pump the needy flesh jutting upwards from his groin whilst sliding between the spread crevice of his cheeks and ghosting across puckered flesh.</p><p>With a feral growl, Uist suckled a nipple between his teeth and worried the flesh until reddened and achingly hard, then lavished the same attention to its mate. Sholto writhed on his lap under the tender assault. Uist flipped open the left compartment of the command chair and located a tube without taking his eyes off his beautiful young mate. He opened it adeptly and squeezed cool gel over his fingers before sliding a thick, slickened finger between Sholto's spread cheeks. He rubbed sensitive flesh before allowing the finger to slide into hot tight heat. Sholto moaned softly at the erotic intrusion and kissed his mate, letting their tongues dance as Uist carefully prepared the small portal that granted him access to Sholto's body.</p><p>Uist helped the smaller man position his hard shaft against the glistening entrance to Sholto's body and holding the younger man's hips to help support his weight, Uist groaned as he was enveloped in Sholto's molten depths. The velvet channel gripped his sensitive flesh tightly and the smaller man panted as he slowly accepted Uist's solid rod. As he finally sat flush with the bigger man's groin, Uist held himself still awaiting his mate's acceptance of the long thick shaft. Finally Sholto began to undulate, letting the head of Uist's arousal rub the special spot deep within and he threw his head back and he ground and gyrated his hips to pleasure them both. Using his powerful arms, Uist raised and lowered Sholto onto the flesh that impaled him, relishing the look and cries of pleasure from the man he loved.</p><p>The scent of Sholto's passion and arousal inflamed Uist and his nostrils flared as he scented the air. His movements became faster, one hand reaching between their bodies to swirl the precome over his fingers before sucking them clean. He then began to pump the slender shaft of his mate in time with the upthrust of his own hips. Four direct strokes were enough to tip Sholto over the edge and he cried Uist's name aloud as his seed fountained over Uist's hand and their chests. The scent of Sholto's release was the undoing of the bigger man and he threw back his head roaring his completion as his seed pulsed into the still rippling channel.</p><p>As his sated organ softened and slipped from Sholto's heated depths, the bigger male took the opportunity to lay the smaller man across his lap and cuddle him close. With a low purr of pleasure he licked his hand clean of his mate's release then kissed Sholto's eyes, nose and cheeks before mating their mouths. As the kiss ended, Sholto sighed in contentment and then scowled. The scowl was completely ineffectual given his post-orgasmic flushed appearance. His face radiated joy rather than censure.</p><p>"I should be really angry with you," he said tapping Uist's nose with a forefinger. "I'm meant to be on duty, not letting my husband ravish me on the command deck."</p><p>Uist's happy sky blue eyes locked with his lover's deeper oceanic orbs and his smiled shyly.</p><p>"I missed you," he offered quietly. "AI was more than capable of scanning for Tristam and I missed you."</p><p>"I missed you, too, love," Sholto hastened to assure his husband cuddling closer to the imposing bulk of the bigger man. "But Rayner needed us last night and I knew once we were finally sleeping you would stay awake to ensure Rayner stayed asleep until deeply sleeping. I thought I would let you sleep in."</p><p>"I would rather lose sleep than time with you, mine. Your presence is the first thing I seek on waking and the last thing I gaze upon before sleep."</p><p>"Love you so much, my husband" Sholto murmured as he sought out one of his mate's large nipples, suckling contentedly on the thick nub. With his left hand he sought out its twin and gently pinched the fleshy nub in harmony with the suckling of its twin.</p><p>Uist demonstrated his appreciation with a low rumbling purr. His hand slipped between Sholto's thighs gently caressing and fondling his spouse's lax genitals. He was content to allow arousal to build more slowly this time and to savour it as it grew between them. He knew Sholto would still be sensitive from his previous climax and he didn't want the younger man to experience any discomfort during their intimate times. Minutes passed and Sholto was soon arching into Uist's hand desperate for a harder touch.</p><p><br/>"Need you, my own," Uist said roughly, the sight and scent of his aroused mate tearing at the fragile control he had.</p><p>"Take me," Sholto begged softly.</p><p>Moving swiftly, Uist lifted Sholto to lay him back on the command chair, flipping a switch that allowed the chair to recline almost flat. He hitched Sholto's thighs over the curved, cushioned arms and gazed with barely contained hunger at the smaller man to wantonly displayed to him. He ensured Sholto's hips were at the edge of the chair and pulled the taut buttocks apart and sheathed himself in the already slick passage. He balanced his upper weight on his arms either side of Sholto's head and began to pump the smaller man's erection in time with the pistoning of his hips. He nipped, licked and kissed Sholto's neck and throat as the slighter man bared his throat for his mate's teeth. As Sholto writhed beneath him, Uist bit down at the juncture of neck and shoulder to raise a mark of his passion and possession. Sholto moaned his approval and Uist felt the tightening of the beloved body that heralded his mate's imminent release. Uist pounded harder hitting Sholto's sweet spot repeatedly, his lover crying out with pleasure, hands fisted in Uist's hair rhythmically clenching and unclenching with Uist's thrusts. With a scream of Uist's name, Sholto arched as best he could under his bigger mate and a stream of pearlescent fluid hit their chests. Uist's roar was seconds later as he was milked by his mate's contracting channel, filling the smaller body once again with his seed.</p><p>As Uist tried to regulate his breath, he was aware that Sholto had passed out. He let himself slip from the haven of Sholto's body and proceeded to lick his mate clean. With a low growl of dark pleasure he lapped delicately at the stretched portal to taste the earthy musk of his mate overlaid with his own seed. Standing, he gazed with an indulgent smile at the boneless body and scooped the insensate form to cradle Sholto to his chest and await the smaller man's awakening. He was aware of the small movements as his mate began to awaken. Unconsciously Sholto pressed into the comfort and warmth of Uist's body. As he became more aware he gazed up at his husband. Sky and ocean met, bridged by love.</p><p>"Love you, mine," Uist rumbled possessively, tenderly stroking sweat-damp hair away from the beautiful face.</p><p>"Love you, my husband," Sholto replied, burying himself deeper into Uist's embrace.</p><p>The two men sat entwined, unconcerned about their nudity. The temperature was comfortable and after two explosive climaxes, Sholto was more asleep than awake held safe and content wrapped in his mates arms and love.</p><p>"Incoming message from Tristam to Silver Star," the voice of AI encroached into Sholto's drifting mind and unthinkingly, the young man started to his feet as the display screen shifted from star-dusted space to show the imposing figure of a strikingly handsome man.</p><p>Dark blond hair reached to broad shoulders and his eyes were a blue-grey of stormy skies. There was a small cleft in his chin that added to rather than distracted from his appearance. Although only visible to just below his shoulders, he emanated physical power and presence.</p><p>"Tristam," Sholto cried aloud with delight. "You made it back early"</p><p>"Indeed," the older man agreed with a slight smile. "Did I arrive too early?" His smile widened into a full grin at the blank look from the nude young man. Sholto only understood the inference as Uist came to stand at his side, a large hand draping across his genitals, another pulling him to the bigger body. Sholto felt the blush start at his toes and suffuse his whole body, leaving his face a glowing pink.</p><p>"Uist, my friend, your mate glows with health."</p><p>"Indeed," Uist agreed with his own smile. "And it is always my pleasure to have him thus."</p><p>Sholto groaned and buried his face against Uist's bulk as the older man laughed easily.</p><p>"AI can see me safely docked..." Tristam began, unwilling to keep his friends and fellow crewmen from being together.</p><p>"We will wait till you are aboard. It is no hardship for us," Uist assured.</p><p>Tristam nodded, knowing he could rely on the cat-like male to speak truthfully to him.</p><p>"Rayner?" Tristam asked, his face turning anxious.</p><p>"He had a bad night last night, but stayed with us. He needed occasional soothing but then slept well. He has coped." Uist replied.</p><p>"Thank you, my friend," Tristam said, the sentiment heartfelt.</p><p>"I am the Protector of your mate as you are to mine. Even so, I would gladly guard his sleep as he is beloved to my mate and myself."</p><p>Tristam nodded, no words necessary.</p><p>"Just don't make a habit of leaving him," Sholto's muffled voice came from the vicinity of Uist's chest. "He does miss you terribly when he can't feel you."</p><p>"I miss him too," Tristam confirmed quietly. "You have my promise."</p><p>As Tristam made his way to the quarters he shared with his younger spouse, he thought of how their lives had started so badly and yet had led to their meeting. Tristam knew Rayner was the other part of his soul. Each man complimented and completed the other, to the point they shared a psychic bond that left Rayner distressed and himself desolate when they were apart and unable to 'feel' each other. In Tristam's case, his earliest memories were of a medical facility. His early memories wiped. He might have been intended as a sex slave, or a child for a childless couple. Instead his genes had been spliced. Some of the genetic material was that from PrideHome. He had been made to see and hear better than humans, better even than Uist. He was faster and stronger and was of above average intelligence, his mental abilities a par with his physical ones.</p><p>He had been rescued by Jameson Peters who at the time was the head of a special crime response team that covered not just earth, but allied worlds of the Planetary Federation. Something had 'clicked' when they had met and Jameson had used every ounce of his power, persuasion and that of his friends to ensure the seven year old Tristam was adopted into his family and not regarded as a freak to be exploited. Tristam had taken to both Jameson and his wife Aurora and had studied hard to repay their kindness and generosity. He watched as young children were often taken in on short term stays by the loving couple, but he was 'their' child.</p><p>When Tristam was fifteen, he had the single biggest life-changing event in his life. He had overheard Jameson talking to the chauffeur he used who was worried about a small boy that distant relatives of his wife had taken on. The boy had been orphaned and seemed to be having some problems dealing with the death and no-one wanted to give him the love and affection he would need. He was being passed around several, what the chauffeur considered, unsuitable couples and he feared for the boy. Smiling to himself, Tristam prepared himself to have another small child around. He wasn't prepared for the reaction on seeing that same small boy.</p><p>The boy was five or six at Tristam's evaluation as he saw the small bundle in his Papa's arms. Dark curly hair peeped out over the blanket in which he was wrapped. One arm was visible and Tristam felt anger welling up at the thinness of the limb. The skin looked dull, but Tristam was sure it would normally be a honey-tint. He felt a pull towards the child and found his arms reaching to take him from Papa's arms. At the same time the child turned and turned pain-filled sorrowful deep brown eyes upon the older boy. Tristam felt as though an empty part of his soul had been filled and tears sprang to his eyes as the boy reached for him. As he took the precious bundle, Tristam vowed he would die before he allowed harm to befall the child again. Extending his hearing as he spirited the boy away, he distantly heard Papa call him Rayner.</p><p>He washed the thin body and dressed Rayner in one of his own T-shirts. Mama had brought some milk and sandwiches and Tristam had sat with Rayner in his arms as the small child had eaten and drunk. Once the food had gone, Rayner had reached to hug Tristam and fallen asleep in the older boy's arms. He had taken Rayner to his bed and slept curled around the thin body. At some point he was aware of his parents entering the room. Recognising them, Tristam simply cuddled closer to Rayner and allowed sleep to claim him again as he heard Mama's voice.</p><p>"I think Tristam's found his soul-mate. It looks like we have two sons now."</p><p>Years had flown by and Tristam had never tried to lead his 'younger brother' into a relationship with him. They still shared a room together when Tristam was at home. It had been hard sometimes when he'd detected a quickening heartbeat or a surge of hormones scented with arousal from the younger boy when they were alone. But he determined that if their relationship were to deepen, Rayner needed to have made the decision for himself.<br/></p>It was the year before Rayner's majority that things finally changed. At the end of the night as the two young men sat in their room on the edge of their beds, facing each other, Tristam had thought back over the evening. Rayner had kissed many people of both sexes, but only Tristam's lips. He had danced with many, but had only melted into Tristam's arms, moulding his body to the older boy's during slow music. Tristam gazed into the deep brown eyes he knew so well and saw the love and desire he'd always sought gazing back at him. He'd slid to Rayner's bed and they had shred their first kiss of passion. Tristam's hand had unthinkingly sought the heat at Rayner's groin and as the kiss deepened, he had squeezed virgin flesh rhythmically until Rayner had shuddered his first release. Tristam had immediately tried to apologise, but Rayner had reassured the older boy. They did, however, determine that they would not go beyond mutual touching with their hands until Rayner was considered adult. They loved each other too much to risk any reprisals. Tristam had promised that if Rayner still felt the same way on his birthday, they would declare their relationship openly and perhaps a year later they could announce an engagement with a wedding after Rayner's graduation. However, life was to interfere with his perfect plans.Tristam had become a member of their Papa's Elite team the year the two young men had declared their love for each other. There had been no problems as the year sped by and both were looking forward to Rayner's coming of age. However, three day's before Rayner's birthday, Tristam had disappeared. He had been betrayed by a contact in the case and now lay bruised and beaten in the hold of a ship. Rayner had become frantic, feeling Tristam's pain, but not able to locate the man he loved. From the day they had declared their love, a psychic link had embedded between them and Rayner had delighted in being able to 'feel' Tristam when he got closer to home and had been trying to extend the distance.Rayner had refused to eat or drink trying to focus on finding Tristam. Their Mama had worried that if Tristam were lost to them, they would also lose their younger son. She had sat with Rayner trying to make sense of what he felt. When he had said that he felt their link was stretching upward, Aurora had gone to her husband with nothing more than Rayner's feeling and her own instincts and asked him to have all spaceships leaving the locality be checked. It turned out to be enough. The rest of Tristam's team had their suspicions about a freighter and had engaged it. Both ships had suffered heavy damage, including communications failure. However, after rescuing Tristam, they had continued with their mission, Tristam feeling something wrong with Rayner, but no knowing the younger's man's heath was deteriorating rapidly. At the successful conclusion of the mission, Tristam had hastened to get home having been gone five days.He had contacted Papa at the first opportunity and had been told to come home without delay. Papa's voice sending chills down his spine. As he'd got closer to home, his link with Rayner hadn't strengthened. All he felt was desolation and pain and the knowledge that Rayner was slipping away, believing Tristam dead. He couldn't break through to reassure the younger man he was there. Words hadn't been needed as he had raced past his parents at the door of their room. He had been focused on the beloved heartbeat that sounded do weak and the scent that was tainted with sickness and near-death. He wailed his pain aloud at the sight of the pale, gaunt figure that lay in his bed. Dark shadows were beneath Rayner's eyes and his face was pinched in pain. Without hesitation he had thrown off his clothes and slid into bed to wrap himself around the fragile form as though he could imbue Rayner with his own strength. Their parents had left them alone knowing that if Tristam couldn't bring Rayner back then none could.For hours Tristam had touched and kissed and talked to Rayner. He had managed to get the smaller man to drink by taking mouthfuls of water himself and pressing the liquid into Rayner's mouth in a parody of a kiss. The younger man seemed to be gaining some awareness and Tristam was prepared to talk himself hoarse if need be.Finally Tristam had felt an almost hesitant squeeze to his hand and slowly two exhausted brown eyes had opened to peer at him.>Dream?< he'd heard in a raspy whisper.>No dream< he'd assured. He had felt tendrils in his mind and knew Rayner was strengthening their bond, opening himself to his soul-mate. Tristam had wept openly when experiencing Rayner's feelings. He knew now he couldn't live without this man as his mate at his side.Tristam hadn't left Rayner's side whilst the younger man recovered. They had announced their engagement at Rayner's deferred party and one year later, they had married. Whilst Rayner had completed his University education, Tristam had taken up a teaching post and it was here they had met the other members of Tristam's personal elite. They had also enlisted the assistance of telepaths in regards their link. Now they could endure the separation but, for Rayner in particular, they were always distressing to a greater or lesser degree.Tristam's reverie had taken him form the docking bay to the quarters he shared with the man he loved. He opened the door silently and gazed at the slumbering form in their bed.Rayner was obviously restless, the thin sheet tangled around long, smooth limbs, leaving him naked to Tristam's gaze. If he had been considered beautiful as a child, in Tristam's eyes, Rayner as an adult was striking in his beauty. Dark hair fell in curls to his shoulders. The deep brown eyes that could be like pools of molten chocolate when filled with love or glitter like jet when aroused were closed. The Cupid 's bow lips were slightly parted and a pink tongue flickered out briefly to wet them. Rayner's skin had indeed been honey-toned and as Tristam's eyes raked across the naked form, the dark discs of Rayner's nipples beckoned. Then with a moan, the younger man spread his legs and Tristam stared hungrily at the dark hair at Rayner's groin and the smooth, slender flesh that lay flaccid.With a feral smile, Tristam mounted the bed and settled between the outspread thighs, sucking the slender shaft into his mouth as he parted the smooth thighs further apart. He revelled in the unique flavour of his lover's musk as he released the thickening organ to lap at the hairless testicles. Taking the almost fully aroused shaft back into his mouth, Tristam began to apply more suction as Rayner began to unconsciously respond to the erotic assault.Rayner's sleep had been troubled since his husband left "Silver Star". He understood and appreciated he couldn't accompany his mate and knew there was little likelihood of any danger to the man he loved, but when he couldn't feel Tristam, he felt desolate, cast adrift. He friends, his family on "Silver Star", and the men that were as close as and more beloved than if they were blood relatives helped as best they could. Without them he wasn't sure he could cope with the separations as well as he did, although even he had to admit he was improving.His dreams had been strangely empty during Tristam's absence. He had even taken up Sholto's offer of sharing the room with him and Uist and had slept well that night, but dreamlessly. Now his dream was strangely erotic. He felt no fear or threat. Instead, he felt his shaft had been enveloped in warm, wet heat. He felt safe and loved and was becoming increasingly aroused. He breathed a soft moan of pleasure as he felt added suction and reached between his thighs to his dream lover. With a start he realised his lover was no dream. His eyes flew open. The sight of his mate between his spread legs, sucking on his aroused flesh was too much for the younger man and with a cry of Tristam's name he climaxed hard, his head falling back to his pillow as he rode out the waves of released passion.As Rayner's orgasm ended, Tristam suckled the softening organ to ensure he had devoured all his spouse's sexual surrender before releasing it to climb astride the boneless body and share a Rayner-flavoured kiss with his much missed other half. He was pleased that Rayner responded so enthusiastically, wrapping arms and legs around the bigger man. He allowed his weight to settle carefully on the slender body beneath him. Trying to balance the need he knew Rayner had to feel his weight and yet not crush the smaller man. He settled joyfully between the parted thighs."I love...""...love you." The men spoke in concert and smiled at each other, revelling in the physical and mental bond. "I missed you," Rayner said softly as he tenderly caressed the cleft in his lover's chin."I missed you, Angel" Tristam affirmed."Will you love me?" Rayner asked anxiously. "I want to feel you inside me, making us one.""Shh, love," Tristan soothed, feeling the younger man's need through their bond. "I want that, too. To not know where one of us ends and the other begins. I want to feel you when you contract around me in pleasure and I want to feel my seed filling you." The older male punctuated his words with passionate kisses as he retrieved the lube from their bedside locker. He kissed his way down Rayner's body to suck greedily at each of the dark brown discs in the centre of each sensitive breast. Rayner mewled in pleasure arching into his mate's touch. As Tristam sucked, he teased the sensitive flesh of Rayner's most intimate entrance before slowly sliding as well lubricated finger inside. As he pressed a second finger into the slender channel, Tristam nibbled around Rayner's navel, occasionally thrusting his tongue inside in imitation of another more intimate act to follow. Rayner moaned, reaching to stroke any part of his lover's skin he could reach. His touches ignited Tristam's passion and the bigger man's breathing became harsher as he struggled to ensure his lover was adequately stretched and slick before plunging into his heated depths. As his third finger slid inside, Rayner began thrusting his hips, impaling himself on his mate's fingers. Tristam sucked at the resurgent erection, ensuring Rayner was as close as he was and then guided the long, slender limbs around his waist."Need you inside me," Rayner begged. "Please."Tristam lined up his impressive length to his mate's glistening portal."Love you, Angel," he groaned as he pressed forward into tight, slick heat. Rayner's slender channel clasped his length from root to tip and as he slid fully home both men moaned their joy.Tristam waited for Rayner to indicate he was ready for the bigger man to move and then began a powerful rhythmic thrusting. He angled himself to brush Rayner's hidden jewel with every movement and the younger man cried out and writhed in ecstasy. Tristam stroked Rayner's erection, knowing they wouldn't last long having been away from each other. All too soon and not soon enough, Rayner arched crying Tristam's name as his seed flowed a second time. A second later, Tristam's voice joined his as he released his seed deep into the willing body. As their climaxes ended, Tristam heard Rayner's plea:"Don't pull out yet.""I won't sweetheart." Instead, the bigger man rolled them carefully to drape an exhausted but elated Rayner over his larger body whilst staying buried in the safe haven of Rayner's body. He smiled as Rayner nuzzled into the juncture of neck and shoulder, inhaling the scent of his bigger mate. Tristam began to massage the back of Rayner's head wanting his young lover to relax into the sleep he needed."Love you," Rayner whispered sleepily. Tristan kissed the curly-topped head and nuzzled at Rayner's temple, lapping at the dampness."Love you, baby. Sleep now, my love."For a while Tristam was content to hold his precious lover and listen to the contented snuffling that came with Rayner's descent into sleep and then allowed himself to join him. The ship alerted the sleeping men that it was time to rise. Smiling, they tenderly kissed before moving to share a shower. As Tristam ran his soaped hands over Rayner's lithe form, another more basic need than cleansing came to the fore. Guiding the smaller man to brace his arms against the shower wall, Tristam used his soapy fingers to prepare the slender channel, proceeding cautiously in case his young lover was sore from their earlier love-making. Although still a little tender, Rayner wanted this and conveyed his need to the older male. Tristam finished his preparations and slowly entered the tight passage. For a few moments the two men simply relished the feeling of being as one in body as they were in mind and spirit. Slowly Tristam began to rock in and out of Rayner's heat. With one hand he teased Rayner's dark cinnamon buds, with the other, the slender shaft arching gracefully to the younger male's abdomen. Rayner's pleasured moans were music to Tristam's ears. With jubilant cries they found their simultaneous release. Tristam ensured all traces of soap were removed and they dressed amidst kisses and caresses designed to show the depth of their mutual love rather than re-arouse.Four faces turned to meet them as they entered the dining area, Tristam's arm proprietarily around Rayner's waist."Welcome, Tristam," Uist smiled broadly. "It would seem that this morning it is your mate that glows with health."At Rayner's puzzled look and Sholto's crimson blush, the two older males laughed aloud."It would seem the adults have been playing whilst we children were innocently sleeping," Theophilus' melodic voice said in an amused tone. The young-looking male stood at a little less than six feet tall, but the graceful antennae above blond, winged eyebrows added another six inches. Silver-blond hair cascaded to waist level and was secured behind elegantly pointed ears. He was slender, almost ethereal and fragile looking but had a strength that belied appearances. His eyes were golden, his skin pale. His antennae acted as a form of smell and his hearing was excellent. He was of a race blessed with longevity and although in the first third of his second century, was in effect the youngest member of the team in terms of maturity."As ship's physician, perhaps I should be concerned at the hot flushes that seem to be affecting Sholto," came from the last of the crew. Xavier was reptilian. He stood at over six and a half feet tall, with smooth, pale green skin. His snout extended by six inches and ended with thick, rubbery lips, hiding a set of strong, sharp teeth and a thick, forked tongue. A frill decorated his neck around the back, which could rise or fall and change colour depending on the reptilian's moods. His hands were long and slender, as were his fingers. His powerful thighs were bulky against the material that covered them and although not the fastest runner, was able to keep running beyond the abilities of his mammalian family. His long tail ended thinly and was useful as a weapon as well as having other uses. He slid his arm around Theophilus' waist and the younger male gazed adoringly at his life-mate. Xavier's species was also long-lived. He was just beginning the last third of his second century, but due to the fast mental and physical maturity of his race, was effectively the oldest of the team."It's nothing, guys," Sholto assured unsuccessfully as another round of gentle laughter came from the two older mammalian males.Tristam came to stand by Uist, who was the second-in-command in his absence. As a PrideHome Warrior, that meant there were certain rituals to follow on Tristam's return. The two Alpha males gently bumped their foreheads together. Then Tristam rubbed his head against Uist and Uist tilted his neck, offering his throat as a submissive gesture to show acceptance of Tristam's standing as absolute Alpha on the ship. Tristam nuzzled the fragile flesh, but did not mark it. The two men then embraced and Tristam kissed Uist on each cheek before moving to Sholto. Tristam smiled gently as Sholto's submissive gesture of baring his throat mirrored his mate's perfectly. Again, Tristam simply nuzzled, then kissed Sholto gently, rubbing his knuckles over Sholto's cheek. Moving to Theophilus, the men embraced, their hands dancing gently up and down each other's backs before Tristam kissed the delicate blond beauty. Finally, he rubbed his face against Xavier's snout as the two males gripped each other's wrists. Once the formal greetings were concluded, Tristam then guided his own mate to the group. Reversing Tristam's order, Rayner kissed Xavier, Theophilus and Sholto before standing before Uist and tilting his head as Uist and Sholto had before Tristam. Uist nuzzled the honeyed skin before rubbing his knuckles against Rayner's cheek as they kissed in an identical gesture as Tristam had used to Uist's own mate. The group then began laughing and chatting as they moved around to begin their first meal of the day.As the meal concluded, Uist noticed the increasing anxiety of his younger spouse. He knew it wouldn't be from the earlier teasing and was also aware that the other man had received a couple of communications from an old friend that seemed to have played on his mind. But before the bigger male could act, Sholto gave a nervous cough and, glancing nervously from his husband to his commander and Protector, asked:"Do we have anything imminent or do we have some days of free time?""There is nothing awaiting our immediate attention," Tristam replied carefully. Although his sense of scent hadn't been recorded as enhanced, it was more acute than most human's and with Uist's tutelage was almost at PrideHome levels and he could scent Sholto's rising nervousness. He took in the flaring of Uist's nostrils and the immediate protective attitude of the cat-man. "Is there something you want to do?""I've had a couple of calls from Jonas. He's been settled for a while now and is always asking for not just me, but all of us to go visit. I haven't seen him since...since Uni when...when he was on secondment...when...when..."Five concerned faces looked at the young man as he struggled and failed to maintain the façade of calm. Uist pulled him unresistingly onto his lap and no-one commented when his face buried itself into the bigger male's shoulder. Sholto was happy to let the scent and warmth keep him safe."If you would like to visit then I'm sure I speak for all of us that we would be happy to accompany you."There was a general murmur of assent and a short silence as Sholto's answer was awaited."He says there'll be a lot of thick snow just now. Perfect for all kinds of Winter sports." The voice held a little more confidence for all it was slightly muffled from Uist's bulk."Then tell him the answer from all of us is 'yes'" Tristam said coming to stroke the smaller man's auburn curls. He dropped his head to kiss the top of Sholto's head and nodded towards the door at Uist. In response the other male swept Sholto into his arms and strode from the room, leaving four men to remember the events that had led to Uist and Sholto's marriage and the forming of the team and family they were today.Sholto and Rayner were two years apart in age with Sholto the older. However, they had become instant friends and shared many classes and Rayner was advanced in his linguistics and they thought that with Sholto's own advanced positioning cultural anthropology, they would probably graduate together. Uist, like Tristam, was at the University as a teacher. He was teaching a year's course in military strategy and was a superb strategist and gave some self-defence classes privately. Rayner and Tristam had quickly noticed the attraction between the denizen of PrideHome and Sholto and had often arranged for the four of them to meet and give the other two men time to get to know each other. Occasionally leaving the two alone in their married quarters to give them somewhere safe and secure to develop their budding romance. Uist had confessed some concerns to Tristam regarding Sholto's youthfulness and virginity. In response, Tristam had told Uist of his and Rayner's relationship and how he had almost lost the younger man before they had even begun to live their lives. <br/>Tension was running high at the University. For the previous two months, two days before the full moon, a student had been kidnapped, beaten brutally and raped. Medical nanobot technology could quickly heal physical wounds, but mental trauma was something that could only be healed by time and love. There was nothing in common between the two students; male and female, different ages, classes appearances, personalities. The only factor they shared was their virginity, leading Tristam and Uist to consider the assailant to be a form of psychic. As a consequence, when the older men could not escort their younger partners, Sholto and Rayner were under strict instruction to be in groups or with each other.In keeping with the instruction, the two younger males were making their way to the married quarters to await the older men. As there were two of them, they believed themselves safe just as Tristam and Uist assumed they would be. Sholto felt the sharp prick of a dart in his neck before the world began to tilt and his limbs go leaden. As he fell, unable to move, he saw a large, masked male figure attack Rayner. The slighter man had taken some defence classes, but was no match for their attacker. As a thick arm tried to encircle his throat, Rayner desperately bit hard at the forearm drawing blood and an enraged below from the assailant. In retaliation, Rayner was viciously punched to the floor and repeatedly kicked with large, heavy booted feet that easily broke ribs. Sholto's last vision was a limp Rayner being shaken like a rag doll.Tristam had known immediately that his mate was being hurt and he had diverted only to get Uist to join them before they raced to the scene of the attack. On finding the limp body of Rayner, both bigger males had screamed their grief and anger. Allowing Tristam to carry Rayner's body, Uist had sped ahead to warn Xavier of the attack and the need for immediate medical attention. The two men were partially consoled to find Rayner was unconscious and, although badly beaten, Xavier was certain that with the prompt treatment and complete rest would heal fully.Sholto had awoken as cruel, hard hands were stripping him. He had whimpered his distress, but the drug made the world seem fluid and waver in and out of focus, whilst leaving his limbs uncooperative. The rapist had conversationally informed Sholto that he had killed Rayner and that knew the young man to be virgin and described in detail how he intended to violate him. His hands roamed arrogantly over flesh that only Uist had previously touched and Sholto had been unable to stop the tears from falling. The man became bored with the psychological torture and, stripping a leather belt from his waist, methodically beat Sholto's bare thighs and buttocks. Before unconsciousness could reclaim the helpless young man, he felt another needle prick in his skin.Theophilus wasn't idle during the initial hours following Rayner's attack and Sholto's abduction. He showed the other three males old schematics of the University and the unused, ancient sewer system that lay beneath. It was his belief that the attacker used this system to enter and leave the University with his victims, explaining why he hadn't been seen carrying the bodies out or back.Xavier pointed out that with their individual abilities, dark tunnels would prove no hindrance for Uist, Tristam or Theophilus. Additionally, Tristam had Rayner's scent imprinted on him and since the attacker would have Rayner's blood he had a trail to follow. Uist could track Sholto in a similar manner and if necessary, Theophilus could track the attacker from the blood identified as not Rayner's. Xavier added that as Tristam had suggested that the six of them would make an unparalleled elite team, they now needed to be successful on their first mission.They had indeed proved successful, rapidly tracking the sadist to his lair, the man arrogantly believing he needed nothing to hide him once he was in the tunnels. He had foolishly attacked the three males, believing the stolen virginity of his victims would invigorate him and give him super-human strength. Instead he had died from a twist of Tristam's strong hands and a broken neck.On awakening back at the University hospital, Sholto had broken down in tears begging Tristam to forgive him for Rayner's death and only calming after being taken to the other man's bedside to see he was alive and recovering. Uist had refused to leave the younger male and as soon as Sholto was fully recovered had proposed to him. The proposal had been accepted without hesitation. Sholto was given permission to complete his course on PrideHome and as soon as Rayner was able he and Tristam, accompanied by Theophilus and Xavier, had joined the other couple. The wedding had been just a few short months later and after the Honeymoon the six had become the Elite team they were today.Now Uist held the naked body of his precious spouse tight to his body. He gently stroked the soft skin of the younger man's back as Sholto buried his face close to Uist's ear under which was one of the older male's scent glands. The scent of his mate so strong and close, combine with the warmth and solidness of his body had quickly calmed the younger man's fraught nerves. That the memories of his abduction and near-rape sometimes overwhelmed him was simply accepted with the same equanimity of Rayner's distress at any absence of Tristam. Uist wondered whether Sholto's recent worry for his brother of the heart had been the final straw. He didn't intend to question his spouse about it. He knew his presence, whether they made love or simply cuddled close, was the normal catharsis for Sholto's quick recovery.Sholto rose from his comfortable bed of his mate's body and gazed into the concerned sky blue orbs."Love me, please" he husked.Tenderly Uist rolled him onto his back without breaking eye contact. He quickly and thoroughly prepared the younger man as they continued to lock gazes. Only when Uist slid home and their mouths meet did Sholto's eyes finally close. Each man moaned their release into the others as bliss claimed them."Love you, mine own," Uist said roughly as he rained kisses on the face of the smaller man."Love you. Yours always," Sholto sighed.After more time simply cuddling together, they showered, dressed and took their places on the command deck.Tristam and Rayner were on deck as they arrived and Uist gave a quick nod at Tristam's raised eyebrow. Sholto's voice was calm and confident as he contacted his friend and made the arrangements for their visit. They would arrive the next evening. Sholto and Rayner slapped their raised hands together with wide smiles as Tristam contacted the planet's equivalent of his father and both ensured it was understood they were holidaying, but retained their special Elite status. As such, instead of leaving their ship at the local spaceport, 'Silver Star' could be housed at a military base and the group would be transported to the spaceport to be collected by Jonas.Jonas was delighted to see his friend again and Sholto embraced him as tightly as he was being hugged. Jonas also recognised Rayner, giving the younger man a brief hug. He knew of Xavier by reputation as he was a physician himself and was stunned to think he would have Xavier as a guest. He didn't particularly recognise the other three men, although from the way the two bigger and older males acted, it was obvious that there was closeness between them and Sholto and Rayner. The stunning blond stayed close to Xavier and Jonas' mind fluttered between wondering if he was a student, companion or servant. He shook his head in bemusement. He hoped Sholto felt up to staying awake for some time so he could understand the relationships so he didn't inadvertently insult or offend.The swiftest mode of transport was electric sled. Jonas showed Tristam and Uist how to programme them to take them to his home."You can either simply allow the machine to drive itself or stand watching. It's like automatic pilot but it recognises hazards and will take appropriate action.""Sounds like fun," Tristam smiled.Each sled was big enough to hold three people plus some luggage. As Xavier felt the cold most intently, Jonas watched as the big lizard was wrapped together with the ethereal blond and Uist volunteered to be their driver. Jonas then watched as Tristam fussed over two darker haired men, settling them on his sled, wrapped warmly. With a curt no he indicated he was ready to move. Jonas checked the cases on his sled were secure and led the way. He was disappointed that Sholto wasn't in his sled, but micro transmitters, in the form of bracelets, allowed conversations between the sleds, but no confidential discussions.Jonas' house was a large building set in its own grounds a few miles outside of the city and the spaceport. There was a scattering of similar homes over the next several miles, but nothing too close. Jonas explained he had wanted to be close enough to the city to work easily, but far enough away for peace and quiet which made this home ideal. Within easy travelling distance were hills and lakes; perfect for sledding or skating. As he led the men from the garage to the door of his home, his wife came out to meet them.Tara was just five feet tall and petite. She had coffee coloured skin teamed with hazel eyes and short cropped dark hair. She smiled her greeting."Welcome to our home. It's good you could finally visit. Please come inside. Martin tells me you're some form of diplomat or envoy?" She ushered the men in, taking blankets and coats as they were divested by the men."It's a pleasure to be here," Tristam spoke for the group. They never revealed their roles as an Elite squad. Their cover was they were a group of diplomats. He quickly introduced everyone. He could see the slight furrow to Tara's face."It may be a little crowded to accommodate you all," she explained. "We do have a second double bedroom on the first floor as well as a box room that hold one fairly comfortably. On the second floor are two double rooms separated by a box room and bathroom. If some don't mind sharing...""Sholto is my mate," Uist purred wrapping an arm around Sholto's shoulders."I did write," Sholto said at Jonas' raised eyebrow. "But I wrote from PrideHome to the Uni. You must never have received it.""Rayner and I are also married," smiled Tristam. "We would prefer the top floor." He glanced between Uist and Xavier."Theophilus and I will take the first floor," he flicked his gaze from Jonas to Tara. "We are also wedded. However, as I find beds somewhat difficult, we would prefer a mattress on the floor and some pillows and cushions. If it isn't too much trouble.""Not at all." Tara called for their maid.The maid had straight red hair and a pinched, freckled face and was very thin. She glared at the group of guests from beneath a long fringe, where she thought her own eyes would be hidden. She was unaware that Uist and Tristam could scent and see her obvious resentment."The first floor room is bigger," Tara smiled at Xavier ignorant of the undercurrent of her maid's dislike of the men. "We can dismantle the bed very quickly and your rooms will be ready in about half an hour or so. Take our guests to the living room and get them some drinks," she added to Jonas as she headed upstairs, followed by the maid.Soon the couples were settled. Uist had scented the room he was to share with his mate, determining its safety. He had then moved the bed to lie along the wall between the windows and door and now Sholto slept with the wall to protect him one side and the solid bulk of his husband the other. Tristam had rearranged the bedroom he shared with Rayner in the same way. Both younger males now slept soundly in their mates' loving embraces.In the first floor bedroom, Theophilus and Xavier were both very awake. Theophilus lay on his back amongst the nest of cushions and pillows carefully arranged by Xavier. The blond male's long, smooth legs were spread wide to accommodate the girth of his reptilian mate and slender feet were braced against the lizard's rump. Theophilus traced random patterns on Xavier's smooth pale green skin and the lavender colour of Xavier's frill indicated the pleasure being touched by and inside his mate engendered. He thrust a single hemipenis deep into the carefully stretched channel and ensured he rubbed repeatedly over Theophilus' hidden jewel to give the beautiful young male as much pleasure as he could. The reptilian's long tongue flickered over the pale, smooth chest occasionally pausing to tease the hard pink nubs. Supporting his considerable weight on his arms, he used the slim tip of his tail to alternate between stroking Theophilus' engorged penis and the smooth, hairless testicles. He revelled in the almost sub vocal cries of pleasure and the erotic writhing of the younger male, Theophilus' head thrashing helplessly from side to side as his body was brought to the brink of bliss. Xavier recognised the signs of imminent climax and his hemipenis formed a knot, plugging Theophilus' now spasming channel. As Theophilus climaxed, Xavier's knot expanded and the reptilian trilled in counterpoint to Theophilus' sweet cries of his mate's name. As Theophilus sagged sated, panting softly, Xavier began to lick the sweet crème of his release. The cleaning complete, Xavier shrank the knot and allowed his hemipenis to slip free. Moving slightly he nuzzled into blond tresses."Love you, beautiful," he whispered allowing his tongue to caress the elegantly pointed ear."Love you more, beloved," Theophilus smiled, tilting his head to receive more of the tender caresses. In turn he ran his fingers over Xavier's aural depressions and the lavender frill. Xavier revelled in the attention. Theophilus then began to hitch his hips in a seductive manner. "I would have all your essence," he murmured shyly.Xavier gazed down in adoration at the younger man. He knew how hard it was for his mate to speak his needs and wants."You're not to sore or sensitive?" Xavier asked."You touch me so gently," came the low melodic voice. "I would have you inside me again, if it pleases you.""It pleases me, my love. Rise onto your hands and knees."Theophilus obeyed kissing his mate as he moved gracefully to present the smooth, ivory globes of his taut bottom. At the sight, Xavier's trill became lower, almost a growl and he gave a mental smile at the shiver of anticipation and arousal that ran through Theophilus' body in response. He probed gently with his tongue between the gently spread nether cheeks relishing the taste of his mate overlaid with his own seed. Males of Theophilus' world produced their own natural lubrication, although Xavier sometimes additionally used oil he had created and which all the couples used. Slowly, lovingly, he used his tongue to caress Theophilus' sweet spot as extra sensitive surgeon's hands caressed Theophilus twitching shaft, coaxing it into hardening again. Theophilus was soon panting and thrusting back onto the moist muscle impaling him and Xavier was pleased that the slender shaft was hard and leaking in his hand. Xavier sheathed his second hemipenis, stimulating Theophilus' prostrate for a minute before forming his knot. As the knot stretched the slick channel, Theohilus began to shudder his release. As the final tremors ended, Xavier pulled the limp form onto his powerful thighs and licked the sweat damp neck as he release his seed to whimpers of pleasure from the younger male.Xavier waited a few moments before tenderly lowering the exhausted body in his arms onto their nest. Rolling Theophilus onto his back, he again licked his mate's release, cleaning the sated form, before gathering the young man into his arms and tucking Theophilus' head into the juncture of his neck and shoulder as a pillow. He kissed the top of Theophilus' head."Sleep, my beautiful one," he whispered. "Sleep safe in my arms.""Love you," came the barely there reply."I love you too, my heart. Sleep."As Theophilus' breaths evened into sleep, Xavier cradled the precious form and remembered how they came to meet.They had spent nearly thirty years together and yet the spectre of Theophilus' father was still a part of their lives. However, Xavier knew just how far the young man in his arms had come and how much that spectre had receded. The first time Xavier had seen Theophilus, he was just approaching his majority and was in a class Xavier was teaching on Theophilus' homeworld. Although all the students were beautiful, whether dark or light haired, when Xavier's eyes had meet the golden orbs of Theophilus and seen the slight blush, his heart had been lost.Xavier was unhappy with the patriarchal society whereby children were seen as commodities for families to 'sell', although the term dowry was used. All prospective suitors provided a dowry to the father of their intended, whether the union was same sex or for a male of female child. Children were often married soon after their majority, despite not reaching their full mental and physical maturity for another several decades. As the planet was becoming a part of the Planetary Federation, this practice was being stamped out. Unfortunately in the province Xavier was in, that was proving difficult. It saddened Xavier to think the beautiful children before him might not have a say in their futures and that eventually, in their turn, the gentle boys could become like their fathers before them: seeing any offspring as possessions to be profitably bartered. His eyes going back to the blond haired, gold-eyed angel, he sent a prayer that he might be one of the luckier ones.Xavier was unable to get the image of the young male from his mind. He had never believed in love at first sight, but Theophilus seemed to have taken Xavier's heart with his shy glances and impeccable manners. The older reptilian hardly dared believe that one so beautiful might care for him, despite having had a variety of lovers of mixed species. It took another week before the lizard could engineer a meeting where just the two males were together. They had spoken quietly and Xavier had felt his heart soar at the hesitating confession from Theophilus that he could not get the teacher from his mind...or his heart. As though the younger male was made of crystal that could shatter, Xavier had allowed their lips to touch in what was one of the most intimate gestures one of his race could offer. Slowly and carefully his tongue had probed against pink, cupid's-bow lips until with a gasp Theophilus' mouth had opened and granted entry. As the kiss ended, Theophilus was panting and flushed and Xavier had quickly cradled the form to his chest realising suddenly that his kiss was the first the other male had ever experienced.They courted carefully and secretly out of necessity. Marcellous, Theophilus' father already had several families lined up as potentials for his youngest son and was literally banking on Theophilus' beauty and virginity to be bankable assets. Theophilus was investigating the correct way in which to pay suit to Marcellous, whilst arranging testimonials as to his personal and familial status to include his wealth. They had seen each other whenever possible for almost a month and Xavier was virtually ready to approach Marcellous when Theophilus arrived very distressed. Marcellous was choosing between two prominent families for a spouse and was going to parade his son before both suitors, a man and a woman, who had already agreed to meet the basic price for Theophilus. Tears were falling from the golden eyes that radiated a mixture of fear and pain and Xavier had been both shocked and frightened. He wanted this beautiful boy. He knew that effectively Theophilus was still a child, but they were in love and with Theophilus having attained his majority, there were no reasons for their union to be prohibited: except Marcellous' refusal. Unthinkingly the two males had left the school in Xavier's car to sit together in a small secluded wood nearby. Xavier had asked Theophilus to marry him and sobbing his joy, the younger male had accepted. Xavier had then lay Theophilus down on the grass and brought the boy he loved to his first orgasm, becoming instantly addicted to the taste of Theophilus' seed. The had lost track of time as Theophilus had lain in Xavier's arms, feeling loved, safe and protected for the first time in his life.<br/>It was the realisation that dusk had fallen that had roused the lovers and Xavier berated himself as he knew Theophilus' brothers brought and collected the younger man from school to ensure his purity. They had returned to the school and been met by a furious Marcellous as well as the agitated cultural liaison assistant assigned to Xavier. There was no evidence of Theophilus' ethereal beauty in the hard face and silver eyes of the man that stood before Xavier. Nothing the reptilian could say was heard by the older man. He ignored the lizard entirely, brutally back-handing Theophilus as he was escorted to his father's car by his brothers. Xavier had promised Theophilus that he would come for him as he watched the hurt and broken young man shoved into the car and driven away.In the two days it took to get Marcellous to agree to a meeting, Xavier had the support of one of his older brothers and a diplomat from his world that was part of delegation investigating how far the planet had come in stopping the practice of selling children as well as a very prominent advocate from the province. He also had his various testimonials and had expressed his desire to marry Theophilus.Theophilus was not present when the advocate eloquently spoke of Xavier's desire to marry the younger man. Xavier was agreeable to meeting Theophilus' dowry price and offered additional recompense to Marcellous as he would be taking the young man with him offworld. It was obvious that avarice held sway with the other man and the figures quoted by the advocate had Marcellous' eyes widening slightly before he could school his face into neutrality. He agreed the payment and Xavier felt a cold fear grip his stomach at the smirk that accompanied the nod that Theophilus may be courted by Xavier and seen before the lizard would have to leave.Xavier had been devastated at the sight of his love. The young man had been beaten and his back was covered with welts and bruises. Xavier hadn't wanted to leave the younger man, but had no choice and the sight of the tears falling as Theophilus was held back from his older lover were as daggers in the reptilian's heart. There were also deep shadows under Theophilus' eyes showing the boy had slept little and he wore only thin leggings of a coarse weave that Theophilus had only seen on the planet's prisoners. The long blond tresses were lank and Xavier worried just where the younger man was being held as it was obvious he had been ostracised from the family.Another two interminable days had passed whilst Xavier obtained the funds needed to provide Marcellous with dowry and compensation. The same men had accompanied him and Xavier had stood impatiently, his eyes roving over the fragile form of his love as he awaited the legal necessities to be completed and for Marcellous to formally agree their union. As his advocate had completed the formal speech, Marcellous had roughly shoved his son to his knees in front of Xavier effectively snarling that he was now Xavier's property and that when Xavier was finally bored, he would know no home with them.Xavier had tenderly gathered the shaking young man into his arms and was grateful to his brother as the bigger lizard wrapped his own coat around the trembling form. The diplomat had pointed out that if the meeting was not one whereby a wedding was the discussion but in fact a sale, that he would ensure the planet would be sanctioned and would further ensure that Marcellous' name came to the fore as the reason. A quick conference between Marcellous and his own advocate had the man grudgingly affirm that he was agreeing to the marriage of his son to Xavier and that Theophilus was free to bind himself to the reptilian.Xavier had immediately gone down on one knee and asked Theophilus in the presence of the gathered witnesses to agree to bind himself to Xavier. The younger man had enough strength to agree before swooning into Xavier's brother's protective embrace. Xavier took a measure of satisfaction in telling Marcellous that had he bothered to check he would have found that Phixians mated for life.Xavier had taken Theophilus to Phixia for their wedding and had ensured that the young male was a virgin till his wedding in deference to his instilled beliefs. It had thrilled Xavier on the day of their first sexual joining to know that Theophilus had known joy from their union rather than an enforced experience.However, other things had come to light about Marcellous that still affected them to that day. As his thoughts dwelt on Theophilus' treatment, the reptilian's frill had turned from lavender to vermillion, indicating his anger and distress. As though aware of his mate's thoughts, Theophilus shifted restlessly and tried to caress the frill. It was enough to bring Xavier out of his reverie and the reptilian crooned a lullaby from Phixia into Theophilus' ear had cradled him closer. With a contended sigh, Theophilus slipped back into deeper sleep and this time Xavier joined him.In their bedroom, Jonas was in bed with Tara. He lay between his wife's thighs, weight balance on one forearm as he alternated between kissing his wife's lush mouth and sucking each of her dark brown nipples in turn. He leant back a little to speak, his voice apologetic."I didn't realise they were all married," he said."No matter," Tara purred as Jonas' hand slid between her thighs, caressing her intimately. "Six beautiful and exotic men at the party will ensure its success. I'm sure they won't refuse to participate. Mmm, nice," she added as Jonas' tongue replaced his fingers. Jonas worked his tongue over and over his wife's intimate core. He felt the shallow breathing and tremors that heralded imminent climax and grasped Tara's hand as she fell into bliss. He rode out her orgasm, swiping his tongue until her sensitivity threatened to turn pleasure into pain and he withdrew.Flowing up her body, Jonas kissed her as he pressed his eager flesh against her opening. He smiled down at her as she wrapped her legs around his waist and urged him inside. They fitted together perfectly and rocked together murmuring love and endearments as they strove for mutual pleasure. Finally Jonas climax and as his seed filled her willing body, Tara crooned:"Love you, love you," into Jonas' ear. As Jonas slipped from her body, Tara cuddled up close. "I hope your friends are as happy as we are," she said."You only need look in their eyes," Jonas panted. Smiling at the tiny body pressed close he added: "Love you, too."At breakfast, Tara gave the six the news of the Ball to be held that evening. It had been planned for some time and Tara turned her best pleading eyes to the six men as she asked them to participate. The six were more than happy to take part and Jonas suggested they follow him into the city and he would direct them to the outfitters they would need for party dress explaining it was a themed ball: full length and velvet; the women's gowns to be full length and both sexes to wear something velvet. It was also a masked ball and the outfitter had supplied the feathered masks for the other guests.In the sleds, Jonas spoke to Xavier of the strange affliction that young people from the city had been suffering from to see if the more experienced physician may be able to shed light on the illness. On describing the anaemia and bruising to the throat, Jonas was shocked to have Xavier suggest that in fact they were dealing with a species of vampire rather than a disease. Xavier suggested that he would call back on Jonas after he had sorted out some samples from the victims and he would examine them and try and confirm his suspicions and that if another victim was to arrive to call him immediately.After picking up their outfits, the six returned to Jonas' hospital. While Xavier examined the latest victim, Sholto explained the effects on mammalian systems. Although there were several parasitic life forms that came under the umbrella title of vampire, there was one common species. Their world was home to parasitic and non-parasitic forms and often they formed mutually happy existences. However, the 'vampires' also travelled beyond their homeworld. There was a convention that they could feed, but that feeding was supposed to be with consent. However, given the chemical make-up of the vampire's saliva and their pychic abilities, even those who consented rarely had any memory of a feeding. Glands in the vampire's tongue acted as an anaesthetic as the fangs penetrated. The saliva triggered almost instant release of endorphins making the victim aroused as well as stimulating pleasure centres of the brain. Memory was inhibited; at best there was an almost hazy recollection of an erotic dream. The throat wound on a first penetration was virtually invisible, only a repeated feeding left tell-tale bruising as the holes were closed by separate tongue glands that stimulated rapid cell regeneration. A victim, who was fed from almost to the brink of complete blood loss, received such a high dose of chemicals in their system that it triggered a need to feed directly from the vampire itself and led to an almost irreversible subservient mental state. Consensual pairings had no need to trigger such dependency. Vampires could command an almost overwhelming loyalty from the first feed due to chemical reaction as well as psychic charisma. They were also shape-shifters, able to appear as anyone they wished. As this world was not a major interplanetary player, local knowledge of such species would be almost non-existent and so Sholto believed the vampire was being careless as they had no fear that they would be uncovered. By breaking convention, the six could invoke instant deportation to the vampire's homeworld - once they had uncovered its true identity.Xavier confirmed that it was a vampire attack and Tristam made a discreet call to the planet's equivalent of his father to alert the planet's Elite squad of the situation. He was asked if direct intervention was needed. However, as he had no idea as to the vampire's identity, Tristam thought it would be better if they conducted more discreet enquiries to see if they could uncover the creature's identity.Tara and Jonas were delighted with the turnout for their party. It was obvious the main attractions, however, were the exotic guests. Xavier's build had made it impossible to clothe his lower half without extensive alterations and so had opted for a dark green velvet waistcoat, left open. Theophilus had selected a tunic in the same colour and wore plain black pants. They had both opted for gold masks; Xavier's plain velvet and Theophilus gold feathers. Sholto and Uist had liked their dress and Sholto modelled his on Theophilus, choosing a deep blue for his tunic and feathered mask. Uist, mimicking Xavier's waistcoat and velvet mask. Tristam made the choice for himself and his spouse. He chose sinfully tight velvet pants for the smaller man with a white shirt open to a deep V and showing his mate's golden skin. His feathered mask was black and silver. For his own outfit, he selected a black and silver shirt that clung to the muscles of his upper body and had the shop customise a plain black eye mask with silver sequins. As a consequence, eyes followed them wherever they went and they were constantly approached for conversation or dancing.Rayner found himself dancing once again with a woman in a midnight blue dress and matching eye mask. Her hair was pulled high on her head. There was something about her that both fascinated and repulsed Rayner and he was embarrassed and confused about the negative feeling. As they danced, Rayner began to feel light-headed but instead of stopping, the woman seemed possessed of incredible strength, spinning them away from the main body of guests. Rayner gasped as he was pushed into a niche in the wall and Tristam stood before him, eyes glittering. Rayner felt the same revulsion briefly before lips claimed his and a knowing hand cupped lax genitals. A tongue rasped against his throat and Rayner moaned softly as arousal spiralled through him. His head spun and he tried to get more friction on his excited flesh as Tristam's mouth worked at his throat. Then he was dancing again, his head spinning, his groin throbbing and he desperately glanced around for sight of his mate.Tristam was in a group standing talking when he lifted his head and scented the air. There was a general scent of arousal from most at the party, but he had caught the scent of his mate's arousal as well as an ill-defined distress. He frowned and a low rumble of anger emanated from deep in his chest. As he pushed his way through the dancers he spotted his mate as Rayner simultaneously saw Tristam and began to push towards him. With his enhanced sight, Tristam focused in on a damp spot on the tight pants and the unmistakable bulge at Rayner's crotch. Before the bigger man could speak, Rayner spoke, his voice hoarse with need:"No more teasing, please." The younger man pressed hard against his husband as he begged, "Take me. Take me now."The content of Rayner's words made no sense to Tristam and the civilised portion of his mind knew he needed to talk to Rayner. However, the primitive and more dominant part focused only on Rayner's desperate need and that of his own to claim what was his. Uncaring of those around him, he swept Rayner into his arms, feeling the tremors of want and need and moved them swiftly to their bedroom. He stripped Rayner rapidly, throwing the clothes as far from them as possible. As he stripped himself, he growled loudly at the sight of Rayner on all fours presenting himself to be taken. Primal demands to take warred with the desire not to hurt and Tristam hastily coated fingers with oil taking little time to prepare Rayner as the younger man demanded to be taken.Tristam controlled his entry into the hastily prepared channel, holding tightly enough to leave bruises on Rayner's hips, but refusing to allow the smaller man to hurt himself by trying to force Tristam deeper before his body was ready. Once Tristam was assured that Rayner's body was ready he set up a punishing rate of hard deep thrusts. The sight of his hard, red flesh disappearing between Rayner's creamy globes served to fuel the bigger man's desire. He slid his arms around Rayner's waist and pulled the younger man to straddle his thighs, ensuring he controlled the speed and depth of penetration. Rayner gave a muted whine as he found himself at the mercy of his bigger mate and then wailed his approval as Tristam pounded against the smaller man's sweet spot with every thrust. Tristam used one powerful arm to lift and lower Rayner to meet his feral thrusts and with the other pinched at taut nipples and fondles the sac, heavy with unspent seed. Rayner screamed his release as Tristam's hand move to stroke the angry red flesh that jutted from his groin. Rayner's contractions around his own engorged flesh were almost painful and as Rayner went limp, Tristam followed down to lie on top of Rayner and thrust hard and fast into the fully relaxed body, muffling his own roar of completion by biting hard enough on Rayner's shoulder to taste blood. Too exhausted for speech, Tristam simply curled protectively around his comatose mate and gave in to his satiated body's demand to sleep.The kitchen was set at a lower level than that of the party and the housemaid paced impatiently. She began to turn as she heard a sound behind her, but was pushed face first up against the table."Brace yourself." A deep male voice ordered and she placed her hands against the table leaning forward. Large, sure hands unlaced her bodice and began to fondle the tiny breasts, pinching forcefully on the small pink nipples till she gasped and writhed against the body behind her."No sound." Was the next command as her skirts were lifted to reveal a naked body beneath. A hand slid between her nether lips and began to roughly caress her sex. The other hand slipped lower and penetrated her with two fingers. She bit her lip at the dual sensations. Hot breath caressed her throat and she bit her lip hard enough to draw blood to obey the order to remain silent. The fingers inside her were replaced by a hard, thick shaft and she was pounded into hard and fast. She could feel her climax building as heat pooled outwards from the fingers rubbing insistently between her lips. As she threw her head back a strong hand clamped over her mouth and her orgasmic scream was silenced. As she shuddered, she felt her lover release inside her and she smiled behind the hand. She fell forward onto the table gasping for breath as she pulled the bodice closed."I knew you'd come," she began turning to look at her lover, but she was alone. Frowning, she ran upstairs, her skirts falling into place. She peered around the corner and her face twisted furiously. Jonas danced with Tara, a satisfied smile on his face; whilst behind them danced Sholto with the woman in the midnight blue dress."You're mine," she hissed and turned back to the kitchen.Uist paced restlessly. His sense of smell was more acute than Tristam's and the scent of multiple arousals was making the cat-man uneasy. There was something underlying the scent that he couldn't recognise. He recognised the lust that partnered the arousal, but there was an undefined something else. He had apologetically detangled himself from the attractive young woman who had been flirting lightly and now just wanted Sholto safe in his arms. He caught sight of his mate in the arms of a woman who looked vaguely familiar. As sky met ocean, their mutual need was instantly conveyed and Sholto moved towards his husband abandoning his dance partner. Uist moved as swiftly and crushed the smaller man possessively to his chest."I need you," Sholto whispered as he melted into his husband's embrace. "Please, Uist. Now." He trembled at the guttural growl from deep in his mate's chest and knew he was needed just as badly.Keeping the smaller man tight to his side, Uist took them to their bedroom. He ripped Sholto's clothes from his body using his razor-sharp claws. He could scent others' arousals on them and Sholto would never be wearing them again. He scented the smaller man, his nostrils flared and Sholto moaned helplessly at the sight of his dominant mate; so powerful, so primal in the moonlight that streamed into their room."I can smell others on you," Uist snarled. "They wanted you."A thrill of fear rippled through Sholto. He knew his bigger mate would never hurt him, but he had never heard the dangerous tone in Uist's voice directed at him before."Only you," he replied. "Only ever you." Sholto did the only thing he could think to appease his mate. He opened his legs wide and bared his throat. Offering his complete submission to his husband.Uist loomed over the slighter man, fighting the primal desire to simply take, not wanting to hurt. The submissive display partly assuaged the primal fire in his blood and loins, but he knew it would burn till he had sated himself in Sholto's body. The sight made his heart constrict with love. Sholto's tiny portal was displayed to his sight; the younger man was pen and exposed and so fragile beneath his bigger body. He gripped his erection and Sholto watched wide-eyed as Uist pumped himself and cascaded his seed over Sholto's chest and groin."Mine," Uist's voice was gravely with restrained passion. "My mate, my scent. No other.""Yours," Sholto affirmed. "Yours now. Please, Uist, please."Uist's spent flesh was rapidly hardening. He leant down and bit the exposed throat, sucking hard to leave a vivid mark and he knew it would be just one of many. Rubbing his fingers in his come, Uist began to work them into Sholto's passage. He continued to suck and bite along Sholto's exposed throat and collarbone as his fingers coated and stretched. The fire in his blood would not let him remain outside his mate for long and with Sholto's cry of pleasure/pain ringing in his ears, he breached the guardian muscle, surging deep inside until his sac slapped against Sholto's flesh. He began an immediate thrusting to pound Sholto's pleasure spot and take away the memory of the pain from the hasty coupling.<br/>Sholto climaxed hard and fast as Uist bit down again on his throat as the hard rod impaling him hit his prostrate. Sholto convulsed with the intensity of orgasm as Uist muffled his wail by covering his mouth with his own and thrusting his tongue in the younger man's mouth to the same rhythm as his thrusts. Uist's second climax was seconds behind Sholto's and Uist groaned loudly as his seed pulsed deep into the pliant body.Sholto had passed out and Uist realised he was still uneasy. He sensed a threat to his mate even though he couldn't put name or form to it. Lifting Sholto in his arms, he carried his precious bundle to a chair. As Sholto shifted restlessly, Uist crooned softly in his ear for a moment before returning to the bed. He pulled the mattress to the floor with ease, positioning it in the corner of the room where he could see both door and window. He retrieved Sholto, and pushed the younger man closest to the wall, his own body wrapped around his mate unknowingly in an almost identical manner to that of Tristam earlier. Although Sholto slept, Uist remained a silent sentinel for a long time before finally allowing himself to sleep.Although mammalian pheromones did not affect Xavier, he could taste them and recognise them for what they were. His tongue could 'taste' scents almost as acutely as Uist could smell them. He had noticed the other two couples had disappeared. He knew the two Alpha males would have felt the necessity to 'claim' their spouses, but that neither had sought him out before leaving was something unusual. The arousal tasted wrong. He had no other word for it.He wondered whether Theophilus would be affected. When he had taken the young man to bind with him, it hadn't taken long to discover his father had beaten the young man regularly. What had enraged the reptilian was finding that Theophilus' 'punishments' were to be stripped naked in his father's bedroom, where the older man would use his bare hand on Theophilus naked buttocks as the innocent young man had lay across his lap. Xavier had mused over the irony that his first loathing of Marcellous had been for his avarice and treating Theophilus as a commodity. However, if his avarice hadn't been stronger, then Xavier's beloved boy may have been raped rather than assaulted. Now Xavier was grateful for Marcellous' avarice. However, Theophilus was often loathe to be open about his desires for fear he was forcing Xavier and being in some way like his father. It had taken many years and a lot of love and encouragement, but Theophilus was now much more active in their love-making."Please, beloved," a soft voice broke into his reverie. "I need you."Knowing the effort those few word would have cost Theophilus; Xavier didn't hesitate to guide his young husband to their room. He had enough presence of mind to be concerned about his mate's obvious need and determined to speak to Tristam and Uist at the first opportunity. However, here, now, his spouse's needs came first.Theophilus straddled the naked reptilian, whispering words of love and need as he stroked across the pale green expanse of smooth skin. Leaning forward he caressed Xavier's frill and aural depressions watching with delight as the frill changed colour as Xavier's arousal began to become apparent. In response, Xavier's tail slid between Theophilus' parted cheeks, the young man's natural lubricant easing the way for the organ as Xavier's hands pinched pink nipples and caressed the slender pink shaft that arched towards the younger male's belly.Theophilus reached back as Xavier released his twin hemipenes. Theophilus' eyes darkened with unspoken desire as he stroked the twin organs and Xavier thrust his tail deep into the intimate channel. He resisted flicking the hidden jewel, as Theophilus looked almost fully undone and now he was equally aroused, the reptilian wanted to be sheathed when they climaxed. Positioning himself, Theophilus threw his head back mewling pleasurably as he impaled himself on the two slender sex organs of his lizard-mate. Xavier ensured he now rubbed deliciously inside his lover and he could see Theophilus was on the edge. Xavier formed his knot holding Theophilus who convulsed as wave after wave of pleasure rolled over him. Trilling his own pleasure, Xavier released his seed as he caught Theophilus who slumped forward. He cradled the limp body whilst his knots slowly dissipated."Thank you, most beloved," Theophilus breathed softly."I love you, beautiful," Xavier whispered, holding the slighter body close. He could feel that the younger man was already asleep.The next morning, by the time Xavier and Theophilus awoke; Rayner and Sholto were already engaged in a snowball fight with Uist. Tristam watched with an indulgent smile. Xavier decided to wait to speak to him until he could get the other man with Uist and without their spouses. He wrapped an arm around Theophilus' waist and watched the three men battle in the snow.Rayner and Sholto tried to pin Uist with a volley of snowballs intended to ensure the bigger man was unable to move as they crept closer to his bunker. However as they leapt over into his stronghold, the strategist had vanished. The two younger men stood confused over where their quarry could have gone. As they turned away from Uist's bunker, he appeared from the cocoon of snow he had buried himself in and pounced, knocking both young men to the ground and stretching over them to pin them in place. He aimed a few hard swats to unprotected rumps before the younger men managed to wriggle free. At this point the bigger male simply wrapped a long, strong arm around each of them, lifting them from the floor and spinning them around. As he stopped, Sholto dropped his head going pliant in his mate's arms. Rayner laughing conceded defeat and the Alpha male threw back his head and roared his victory. He gave Rayner a kiss to his cheek and another swat to his rump as he released him and then kissed his own mate deeply."I think that is your cue to offer your mate some tender loving care," Theophilus laughed musically.As Tristam exited, Theophilus turned in his husband's arms. Xavier could see the blush that stained the pale cheeks and knew Theophilus wanted to say something but was struggling. Instead, the blond took one of Xavier's hands and ran it over his own taut buttocks before pulling it back into a half-hearted swat, immediately burying his face in his bigger mate's shoulder."Speak to me, precious," Xavier begged softly."I have watched our family play this way for years. Originally they were very careful to keep such play from my eyes, but they forget more often now. I do not want them to change what is affection between them because of my father's perversions. Nor do I want for us to have to restrict how we play together. I would have you touch me like this more. I may never enjoy ...spanking... as love-play, but I would like to try these touches."Xavier crushed the smaller body to him. He knew he had often gone to playfully touch Theophilus this way and refrained at the last minute, afraid of his mate's reaction. However, he understood Theophilus' desire to break free of the ghost of his father."I promise I will not make any decisions that affect us both without consulting with you in future, my heart," Xavier vowed. He swatted the tight rear, receiving a muffled gasp and a gentle wriggle. "But if it is too much at any time, you must promise to tell me and not force yourself.""Promise. I love you,"Before either man could say more a cry of pain they recognised at Tristam's voice caused them to break apart and run for the stairs.They followed footsteps round to the rear of the house. Rayner sat slumped; two puncture wounds leaking tears of blood marred the golden skin of his throat. Tristam reached carefully for him. They could hear rayner's mumbled words that made little sense."Not Tristam. Not Tristam.""Rayner," Tristam spoke quietly not wanting to frighten his hurt spouse. "Rayner, it's Tristam, love. Let me help you.""Tristam?" Rayner asked stretching out a shaking hand. As he touched his mate's face, Tristam bit back a groan of pain. The psychic bond sent lances of pain through his skull as well as feeling the hurt from the neck wounds."Let me," Uist scooped up an unresisting Rayner.Rayner kept eye contact with his husband."It looked like you but it wasn't. I felt it this time. Tried to stop it. It hurts," he sobbed softly."I think he didn't immediately fall under the creature's psychic hypnotism and fought it off with his own psychic ability, but it's caused some kind of mental backlash. It also meant the creature hasn't dosed him with the chemicals to avoid pain." Sholto hypothesised from his vast store of cultural information.Inside, Rayner was put back to bed and Xavier injected a small dose of nanobots to help heal and replace the lost blood. As Xavier tended to the hurt young man, Theophilus went to question the housemaid who was the only other person in the house. On his return he advised the anxious men that the only visitor to the house was Karalyn, wife of Tara and Jonas' nearest neighbour Rawson. She had apparently left her mask behind."I'm going to the house," growled Tristam."No," Theophilus held his arm, speaking gently. "Stay here and comfort Rayner. He needs you. You can help him heal faster than the nanobots. Hold him, make him feel safe. Uist and I will go."Tristam gazed at the golden orbs filled with love and concern and pulled the slender man to him rubbing their foreheads together before giving the blond beauty a kiss on the cheek."You're right, Theophilus. Uist?""I agree. Sholto and Xavier will look after you as you tend your mate. There is still no reason for this creature to believe we know who or what it is."As Uist and Sholto drove away in the sled, no-one noticed their silent observer or the subsequent telephone call.The men were greeted by Rawson. The man was spidery and thin. Thin, wispy grey hair dotted his skull, his skin was jaundiced and his eyes muddy grey pools. However, his wits seemed sharp enough. He gave them a shaky smile in greeting."You must be Jonas and Tara's guests. Karalyn told me about the party. Unfortunately I'm not well enough to gad about at the moment. An old recurring infection," he smiled ushering the two men into his house and the sitting room. "What can I do for you?""We were rather hoping to speak to your wife," replied Theophilus giving his best smile. He felt uneasy and he could see Uist felt the same, but this frail old man was hardly a threat."Karalyn was here," the older man nodded. "But she has work to do at the hospital and went in a couple of hours ago. Can I give her a message? Is everything alright?" The man was starting to shake and Theophilus laid a gentle hand on his arm to reassure him."We think she may be able to help us. One of our friends was hurt and she may have inadvertently seen something that may help us found out how. Are you well?" The blond was now very concerned at the man's tremors."Medicine," the man gasped pointing to some pills. "Kitchen downstairs. Need water.""I'll go," said Uist as Theophilus moved to hold the man and help get the tablets. When Uist returned, Rawson was still in Theophilus' arms. Uist's low warning growl seemed to snap Theophilus into awareness and he quickly helped Rawson with his water before moving to sit away from him, a tiny frown marring his smooth forehead."When your wife returns, perhaps she could contact us at Jonas' home," Uist said. The cat-man wanted them out of this house. Something about it made him uneasy in the way he had been at the party, but now his protective feelings were all directed towards Theophilus."Of course," Rawson agreed.Back at Jonas' home Uist and Theophilus confirmed that Karalyn hadn't been at the home and Xavier put a call through to the hospital for Jonas to watch for her there. Xavier explained that Rayner was resting peacefully with Tristam. The four men resigned themselves to a waiting game over the vampire.The next morning, a pale-faced Rayner and hovering Tristam joined the rest of their family for breakfast. Tristam was feeling frustrated that Karalyn seemed to be a step ahead of them and kept glancing with concern at his mate. The maid came in with the phone and passed it to Tristam."Mr Jonas for you," she said curtly."Tristam," Jonas' frantic voice came through. "Karalyn is here. She turned up with another girl who seems to obey her. She's taken two groups of children hostage. She wants to see you and your people. If she sees security or police, she'll kill the children. One group are downstairs in the basements, the other on the top floor.""We're on our way," snarled Tristam. He quickly explained the situation to his family."Rayner should stay here," announced Theophilus. "And Sholto should stay with him."Uist shot the blond beauty a strange look. To the cat-man's sensitive ears, Theophilus' voice seemed a little stilted, but no-one else seemed to notice and he let it pass."That's fine by me," agreed Sholto. Rayner nodded but looked unhappy."I'm not strong enough to be of help," he said morosely. Tristam enveloped him in a hug."Stay here and stay safe," he murmured.At the hospital, Theophilus suggested he and Xavier take the upper level and Uist and Tristam the basement. The strategy decided, the four split up. As they came out of the elevator Xavier couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. As they entered the ward the children were being held in, the reptilian was surprised to see that they had simply been left inside a large decontamination unit that was double doored. Leaving Theophilus outside, Xavier cautiously entered the unit to check on the children. The look of fear on one young face at something behind him had the lizard turning.Theophilus stood unmoving, his eyes vacant. Behind him stalked Karalyn. Xavier screamed his young husband's name, but the speakers to the outside had been disabled along with the controls to open the unit from inside. Xavier lashed his tail against the windows trying to break them, but despite his strength, only tiny cracks appeared in the resilient material. Xavier watched helplessly as Karalyn advanced on his unknowing lover, morphing into Rawson with a feral smile, before taking his own more bestial form. The vampire had thick leathery skin on his lower half, with a smooth hairless chest. His dark hair hung straight to his shoulders, from the back of which sprouted strong leathery wings. His face was thin and pale, his smile revealing the sharp canines.Theophilus blinked and frowned at Xavier in the unit. Xavier realised his love had been under Rawson/Karalyn's hypnotic power, the man Uist and Theophilus had seen had been the vampire itself. As Theophilus began to move, the slender man was stopped by a long, strong arms wrapping around him, trapping his arms to his body. A large hand fisted in his hair, pulling his head sharply to the side and exposing the vulnerable throat. Theophilus struggled in vain as sharp teeth punctured fragile flesh. For a few seconds, the younger man met the distraught eyes of his older husband, trying desperately to convey his sorrow and love before he was overwhelmed by the chemical cocktail surging through his system. The creature ripped open Theophilus' shirt, pawing at the smooth expanse of chest, a hand cupping the involuntary bulge at Theophilus' groin.Xavier felt tears slide down his face. The creature was going to violate and kill his young husband before his eyes and Xavier was helpless to stop it. He could see the vampire actively sucking Theophilus' lifeblood, swallowing rapidly and Xavier could also see Theophilus starting to sag from the blood loss. Suddenly the creature stopped feeding; licking closed the gaping wounds, leaving two badly bruised marks in their wake. He watched as the vampire turned the unconscious blond in his arms and let the slender body fall over a shoulder."You should have known better than to try to best a vampire," it said smirking at Xavier as the lizard threw himself repeatedly at the windows. "On my homeworld, I will have the envy of many when they see three such beautiful brides as I will bring."Xavier stopped and stared. 'By all the gods, the creature intended to go after Sholto and Rayner.'"They will all look more beautiful still when impregnated with my embryos. Three offspring every fertile cycle will ensure me a powerful dynasty."Xavier silently screamed his rage and fear as he watched the creature caress the backs of Theophilus' legs to squeeze each buttock in turn, leaving no doubt as to its ultimate intentions."Say goodbye, lizard," the vampire added as it unfurled its wings and left.Locked inside the decontamination unit, Xavier flung himself again and again at the window, uncaring of any hurt to himself.Minutes seemed like hours before Tristam and Uist appeared, just as Xavier finally broke through the window."Theophilus?" Tristam asked succinctly."Taken. Still alive, as a breeder. It wants Sholto and Rayner, too.""We can't contact them. Our communicators are down and the phone isn't working.""Theophilus couldn't have interfered with them or the phone," said Xavier. "He was always with me when he returned.""Then there is another," began Uist."The maid," groaned Tristam.Sholto's head pounded and his arms were pinioned behind his back. He groaned as he tried to move. The sat up sharply, despite the pain and nausea. The vampire released its mouth from Rayner's throat and Sholto gazed with concern at the vacant look in his brother of the heart's eyes. He couldn't suppress a small whimper as he saw Theophilus stretched unconscious alongside Rayner."Take care of Theophilus, Rayner," the vampire instructed and Rayner began to caress Theophilus' hair and face. "Now you, my sweet morsel," it added turning to Sholto."Please, master," the maid's voice stopped the creature as it moved towards the young man. "I have done all your bidding. I have been faithful. Will you not reward me?""What would you have of me?" the creature asked moving to her side, his eyes raking lasciviously over Sholto."Take me with you. Make me a bride," the maid asked breathlessly.The creature barked an unkind laugh. "You? Look at yourself and then at them. You cannot compare to any of them. They are true beauties, each different in looks, temperament and taste." The creature licked its lips at the last word. "Even their blood is sweeter than yours. Even so, I can only transport three with me and I will not exchange one of these beauties for one such as you."The maid gave a screech of rage and lunged towards the prone form of Theophilus, a knife glittering in her hand. "Then I will replace one," she screamed.Sholto watched numbly as the vampire was on the woman before she could harm his blond brother. The vampire shattered her arm and then fastened its teeth to her throat, savaging the flesh. The woman's scream turned into gurgles as her blood spurted her life away. Dropping her and ignoring her, the vampire wiped her blood from its face and strode to Sholto.Sholto tried to buck the creature off him, but was unable to gain any leverage. He moaned softly as the creature's saliva entered his bloodstream. He hitched his hips in response to a caress at his groin, the events of the last few moments forgotten in a mix of arousal and euphoria. The creature fed until Sholto, as Theophilus, was unconscious."Bring our blond beauty, Rayner," the vampire instructed as it swept Sholto into its arms. "Have you ever sampled the pleasures of his body?" The creature smiled at the slow shake of Rayner's head. "Good," it said. "I will enjoy watching you take each other almost as much as I will enjoy taking you myself."<br/>As the creature strode from the room, Rayner trailing in its wake, it failed to notice the spasm of pain on Rayner's face and the fleeting few seconds of awareness before the blank look returned.In an outhouse close by Rawson's home, the vampire opened a stasis tube. The tube opened into three compartments. Quickly the creature stripped his three victims, pausing only briefly to admire the beautiful bodies naked, before securing each young man in place. The tube would keep the men in suspended animation until the vampire could get back to its homeworld. It set the tube to ensure its weight was at a manageable level for its strength and then loaded it aboard a much more powerful snow sled."Soon," he whispered caressing the tube.Tristam, Uist and Xavier had leapt into a snow sled as soon as they had ensured the children in Xavier's decontamination unit were unharmed. They knew the creature had a head start, but they knew its destination. Tristam called the Elite and advised them of their destination and a rendezvous was arranged. They charged into the house and found the freshly dead body of the maid. Tristam and Uist's screams of pain and loss caused even the men of the Elite outside to shudder. With only one other known destination, three sleds raced to Rawson's house, only to find the place deserted.They had missed the creature. Tristam and Uist's undulating wail rent the air.In its guise of Rawson, the vampire stretched out on his bunk aboard the cargo vessel. Safely in the voluminous hold was his personal, precious cargo. Several ships had left around the time of his departure and there was nothing to say he had even left the planet. He had used his powers to get himself smuggled aboard by the ship's Captain. This was his room. When they next made touch-down, he would adopt another persona and obtain a nice ship and get himself home. He smiled, superciliously; his family would take a step up his world's social ladder with the addition of three such perfect specimens as his new brides. He was sure that once he had sated his own lusts, he would be able to have others of his kind pay to enjoy them.He sat up suddenly as the lights dimmed, the room lit only by a dim flashing red light."Security Elite boarding. This is not a drill. All crew to their rooms. Repeat. All crew to their rooms. This is not a drill." The disembodied ship's AI intoned.Rawson snarled. There was no way for him to have been found. Thoughts that the captain was a smuggler flitted through his mind. He morphed into his true form and made his way to the hold. He would not leave his cargo behind; they represented too much to him.The hold's lights had also been dimmed and the red flashing light created dark patches of shadow and an eerie feel to the huge hangar. He screeched with fury as he found his stasis tube was missing."I thought this would be where you went first," Tristam came into view at the top of the passageway. "The tube is safe with Xavier. He is already freeing our spouses."Rawson growled and stepped sideways to match the movement of Tristam. He glared at the man, keeping his movements parallel to the human."They won't come out of stasis for a few hours," Rawson sneered. "More than enough time to deal with a mere human and put them back under my control.""You won't lay a filthy hand on them again," Tristam vowed."Do you think you can defeat one of my kind?" Rawson hissed. He moved forwards rapidly, surprised at Tristam's own speed as the male vanished quickly.As they faced each other next, the distance had closed and Rawson could clearly see the look on Tristam's face was on of confidence, not fear. The creature growled low in its chest as it extended its wings to look more intimidating. It stalked towards Tristam, who simply struck a defensive pose ready for the imminent attack.As the creature hurtled towards the man, it was intercepted and pinned to the ground. Shrieks of fury became shrieks of fear. Strong teeth tore at the vampire's flesh and claws shredded wings and slashed at its legs. It wasn't being attacked by a human. Although the creature had vast recuperative powers, it needed time to get away and heal. It tried to attack in its turn, only for its opponent's teeth to latch at its throat. Thick fur deflected the vampire's own attempts to claw and it could feel its strength ebbing. As though from a great distance, the creature heard Tristam's voice one last time."You tried to take what was most precious to us. No-one touches what is precious to us with without due retribution". With a downward slash, Tristam severed the vampire's head, watching dispassionately as the creature turned to dust.Uist stood, but it wasn't the Uist anyone would recognise. As a Warrior, the cat-man could for short, intense periods, become a creature of PrideHome's past. He was more beast than man, covered in thick fur, his teeth and claws longer and sharper. It was a secret known only to the six and to a select few on PrideHome. No-one would know this was how the vampire had been defeated. As Uist's body resumed his normal form, bruising and scratched became apparent and the cat-man was dazed from the fight and the change. He nuzzled Tristam and allowed himself to be led away.It had taken a full day of complete bed-rest before the three younger males had been permitted to move by highly attentive older mates. They were aboard Silver Star, none of them wanting to return to Jonas' home following the death of the maid and Jonas and Tara were staying in town while their home was gutted and cleaned.Tristam nuzzled Rayners hair from his face and kissed the tip of his nose."Without our bond, I might have lost you," Rayner whispered."I would have gone to ends of the universe to find you," Tristam replied. "I need to make you mine again.""Yes, please," begged Rayner. "Let me know I'm yours."Slowly and tenderly the bigger man prepared his young spouse. His fingers sought the tiny portal as he sucked on each dark nipple till they were twin peaks of sensitised flesh. His tongue flickered down to the light trail of hair that led to Rayner's public pelt. He paused, inhaling his mate's musk deeply, causing Rayner to cry out in pleasure and buck his hips causing the engorged, the slender shaft to bob enticingly. Licking the reddened head, Tristam slid a second finger into the velvet channel and purposely rubbed Rayner's sweet spot till the dark beauty begged to be filled. Thrusting a third finger in briefly, Tristam then positioned his aching flesh at Rayner's glistening entrance and then sank in to the hilt in one slow thrust. Rayner panted shallowly as he accommodated to the large intruder until his body welcomed it. Soon they were locked together in bliss, kissing desperately as their bodied soared to completion and as they flew they cried each other's name in their joy before settling once again cuddled closely, sharing breaths.Tristam's arms tightened around his precious mate. He knew that Uist and Xavier were as equally urgent to reclaim their younger mates, but the other two males were a little more fragile than Rayner following the rapid blood loss. They needed a little longer before they would be able to share the same joy as he had just experienced in reclaiming his spouse. He kissed the top of the curly head beneath him, smiling at the soft snuffles indicating his mate was already asleep. Content, the bigger male allowed himself to join Rayner in sleep.

<p><b>Silver 2: Smoke and Mirrors</b></p><p>Eyes followed and heads turned in a mixture of admiration and lust as the stunning blond strode purposefully through the white sterile environment. Glances and murmured comments were ignored equally, nothing interfering with the sole focus of navigating their way through the indoor maze, which they were finding claustrophobic. The blond's long slender legs were encased in tight, green leather pants with a darker green tunic that barely skimmed their hips. The blond's long hair was secured behind elegantly pointed ears, cascading like a golden waterfall to the slim waist. The vision was both beautiful and ethereal. With a sigh of relief they finally stood outside a laboratory door. Golden eyes perused the signs of Private, No Admittance and Plague Control. A pink tongue lapped nervously at delicate lips. With a fortifying breath the blond rapped at the door and stepped inside.</p><p>The reptilian scientist looked up, surprised by the intrusion. No one except the overall scientist in control of the medical complex sought him out and then only after contacting him in advance. Although his medical expertise was desperately needed by the planet, many in the complex had a deep-rooted dislike of off-worlders; especially those whose appearance differed greatly from their own humanoid form. Although the world was trying to integrate with the myriad of other planets and peoples beyond their solar system, xenophobia was still ingrained in many.</p><p>The lizard man was tall and muscular, the baggy lab coat doing nothing to disguise the bulk and power of the male. His lips curled back over strong, sharp teeth and the frill around his neck changed from the varying hues of green to a pale lilac. His tail swished behind him as he recognised the form standing anxiously in the open doorway. He held out large, sensitive hands.</p><p>"Beautiful," he whispered.</p><p>"Husband." The blond responded and hurried to be caught in a strong embrace before being swung around in evident joy.</p><p>The forked reptilian tongue flicked over the blond's mouth as the pink lips parted to invite a more intimate caress. A deep musical trill permeated the air indicating the pleasure of the reptilian holding the striking blond mammal. As he lowered the slender form to the floor, he felt the arousal at the blond's groin and palmed the bulge possessively.</p><p>"I have missed you, my heart," the lizard murmured, nuzzling into sweet smelling blond tresses. "Are you sure it is safe for you to be here?" he added anxiously, pulling back to gaze at the golden eyes.</p><p>"The all clear was announced an hour ago. Do you think Tristam would have allowed me to leave Silver Star to be here if unsafe, irrespective of how my soul cried for you?" the blond smiled reassuringly.</p><p>"Beloved," the lizard crooned. It was hardly surprising he hadn't been notified, but there were more important matters to attend to now. His hand caressed his mate's need.</p><p>"I desire you, Xavier," the man in his arms pleaded. "I love you."</p><p>And I love you, Theophilus," the reptilian replied. "I have a nest through here," he indicated an inner room. "Let me lock the outer door."</p><p>Xavier then ushered his slighter mate into the small room that had been his living quarters for the last four days. It contained a nest of thin, old cushions, a large chair and a small table. He heard the distressed sound from his beautiful lover. "Comfort was not a consideration," he said nuzzling and caressing. "But that matters naught now you are in my arms."</p><p>Theophilus pulled free and disrobed with what he considered indecent haste, but he longed to once again be joined with the one he loved. He quickly lay in Xavier's nest and gazed adoringly up at the dominant male.</p><p>Xavier's breath caught as the light of the dim lamp made Theophilus' skin glow with a golden hue. The slender, hairless limbs were as a siren song to the lizard. He devoured the sight of his beloved: naked, willing, open; in *his* nest. *His* mate. Xavier's trill dropped so low as to resemble a growl as he roughly removed the clothes he wore, throwing them carelessly aside. He then stood looming over the slender, supine form. He watched as arms and legs opened in silent, but unmistakable invitation.</p><p>"Please," Theophilus' melodic voice caressed Xavier's aural depressions. One single word that was both a plea and a command Xavier could not nor would not refuse. He displayed his teeth in his unique smile again as he dropped to blanket the younger man. Deceptively strong arms and legs wrapped around his shoulders and hips drawing him unresistingly closer and his tongue flicked beyond the willingly parted lips to the warm wet cavern beyond. Xavier reacquainted himself with his mate's sweetness before reluctantly withdrawing.</p><p>"I have missed you so, my husband," Theophilus panted. He pressed soft kisses to pale green, smooth skin.</p><p>"I could not chance any of my family contacting this plague," Xavier groaned. "Much less you, my beloved mate. My constitution ensured my immunity, but one I could not share with you. It has indeed been a long lonely time without your presence."</p><p>The reptilian shifted so his tongue could flicker over his mate's pink nipples, the perfect nubs pebbling instantly. Strong teeth bit down on the peaks with expert precision to ensure mounting arousal, his mate's breasts were highly sensitive and an erogenous zone for both males. He licked lower, tasting the smooth skin of abdomen and hips before the long, agile muscle wrapped around the base of his husband's smooth, slender arousal. He felt the blond buck with a sweet cry of pleasure as his tongue laved the engorged head greedily swallowing the pearly pre-come. His large hands slid under smooth toned buttocks, lifting upwards and outwards to display his mate's tiny pink portal.</p><p>Theophilus arched crying his pleasure aloud as his mate licked his opening. The reptilian tongue pressed inside his tightly furled aperture to taste the blond's natural lubricant. Theophilus knew his lover would prefer to assist dilation with the oil Xavier himself had created, and that all of their family used, but it hadn't occurred to him to bring any.</p><p>Xavier found the intimate taste combined with the pheromones his mate was producing were a potent aphrodisiac. He needed to mate, to claim that which was his and his alone.</p><p>"Love you, Beautiful," he whispered.</p><p>"Want you so much, my husband," Theophilus groaned.</p><p>The bigger male moved to lie at his young husband's side. His tongue wrapped around Theophilus' erection and began a combination of rhythmic contractions and stroking. The rough surface of the reptilian tongue provided an extra stimulation to further inflame the blond's arousal. Xavier slid his tail between spread thighs and allowed it to penetrate the writhing younger male. As it slipped inside, Xavier wound it into a corkscrew to ensure Theophilus was stretched to accept his twin penises. He made small thrusting motions with his tail, further encouraging Theophilus' natural lubricant to coat the slender channel. With expertise, Xavier timed gentle tugs to taut teats with the forked tip of his tongue laving the head of Theophilus' penis and the tip of his tail rubbing the hidden jewel deep in the blond's body.</p><p>The triple stimulation was too much for him and Theophilus' came as he cried his husband's name.</p><p>Xavier's snout covered the fragile flesh and the reptilian felt the pulses of his mate's release hit the back of his tongue. He was exceptionally careful to protect his mammalian lover from his sharp teeth. Only when Theophilus sagged spent, did Xavier release the sated organ and swallow its warm salty essence. His tail continued to pulse within Theophilus' boneless body as Xavier repositioned himself between his lover's widespread legs. He hooked slender limbs over his arms, spreading the smaller male open wide. His twin hemipenes unsheathed from inside his body, slick with lubricant as his tail withdrew from moist heat. Xavier heard his lover's moan at the sight of the glistening organs. It was a measure of Xavier's arousal that both penises had unsheathed. His young husband could accommodate both simultaneously, but would be fully filled during their love-making.</p><p>The soft mewls of pleasure from the slender male beneath him were as music to the reptilian. He slid effortlessly inside the prepared channel and began to stroke rhythmically; ensuring Theophilus' sweet spot was stimulated constantly. The lizard's tongue flicked over throat, collarbone and as far down as the peaked, pink nipples whilst his tail sinuously slid against Theophilus' sensitive hairless sac. The smaller man's hips moved in perfect harmony with his mate, his own satiated rod reawakening, trapped between their undulating bodies. Xavier knew they were both approaching their peak and his hemipenes produced their knot, completely plugging his husband's slender channel.</p><p>Theophilus groaned as he felt the stretch of his internal muscles from the forming knot. He panted shallowly as tendrils of pleasure began to bloom outwards from deep in his groin, radiating wave after wave throughout his whole body. A sharp nip to an already hypersensitive bud coinciding with his mate's hand on his primed shaft had Theophilus arching and crying Xavier's name as his essence flowed a second time between their bodies.</p><p>The contractions around his already eager organs and the combined scent and sight of his mate in sexual ecstasy finally fractured the reptilian's control. Pulse after pulse of his hot seed filled his mate, till both organs were fully spent. As he recovered from his orgasmic high, the bigger male rolled their still joined bodies to allow his lissom mate to drape voluptuously over his now sated body. The lizard sighed in absolute pleasure.</p><p>"Stay in me for a while longer," Theophilus' soft melodic voice begged.</p><p>"It would be my pleasure, my heart," Xavier replied. He gave a mental frown as he regarded the beloved visage. In his joyful reunion he had not noticed the dark smudges beneath his mate's eyes and the tiny lines around them that told of nights without sleep and the consequential headaches. He began to massage the back of his lover's head, knowing it would relax the younger man. He smiled as Theophilus' weight settled more heavily, the already satiated body relaxing further under the tender ministrations.</p><p>"Sleep in my arms, my love," Xavier crooned softly.</p><p>"Love," came as a reply on a soft breath as Theophilus sank into the first real sleep since Xavier had left the haven of Silver Star.</p><p>Xavier allowed his knot to dissipate and re-sheathed his organs. His tail wrapped around the blond male holding the smaller man close to his body, lovingly and protectively. Soon, Xavier slid into his own deep sleep.</p><p>*****</p><p>An insistent bleep awakened the reptilian. He was pleased to note it hadn't disturbed his exhausted mate. Gently he untangled their limbs and went to answer the call. He listened, replied and returned to the slowly stirring beauty in his nest. Crouching next to the supine form, Xavier shamelessly began to massage the back of Theophilus' head encouraging the smaller man to resume his sleep. He smiled as his tactic worked.</p><p>"Sleep a little longer, my love," he whispered. "When I return we can leave this inhospitable place."</p><p>"Take care," came the sleepy response.</p><p>Xavier dressed rapidly. The sooner he received the official confirmation he was no longer needed here, the sooner they could return to their ship and their family. In his haste, although Xavier closed the outer door, he failed to additionally lock it.</p><p>Theophilus became aware of being touched by hands he knew were those of strangers. With a rapid movement, he scuttled to sit clutching a sheet to his nude form. Leering at him were two men who were denizens of this world. The lascivious gazes had the blond fearing for his safety. He was unaware that in the comparative darkness neither the colour of his eyes, his slanting brows nor his small antenna were visible.</p><p>"You see, Byran," the larger of the two men hissed. "I told you the lizard had been provided with entertainment."</p><p>The speaker was large and swarthy with lank, dark hair and smelt unclean. Theophilus would have found him unattractive even if his eyes and face hadn't been filled with a mix of hate and lust.</p><p>"We have worked just as hard and for longer and have been denied such pleasures," the man continued.</p><p>Theophilus spared a glance at his companion. He was similarly swarthy, but with red hair. Although he was less physically repugnant, Theophilus still feared the lust in the hazel eyes.</p><p>"Please," the blond said quietly. "I am bonded to Xavier." He meant it to convey his status as married to the reptilian, but he could see it wasn't understood. Before he could try and explain further, a strong hand latched around his ankle to pull him closer to the two men.</p><p>"I don't care what fancy name you give it, whore," the dark man growled. "I've been cooped up here over a week with no means of relieving tension or being able to have the pleasures a body like yours can provide. I want what you gave the lizard."</p><p>Realising their intent, Theophilus made a small movement as though capitulating to his aggressors. As the men leaned eagerly forward, Theophilus lashed out with two balled fists to send both men tumbling backwards. He surged to his feet preferring not to fight naked, unarmed and outnumbered. Clutching desperately to the sheet, he flew to the outer door. He reached for the handle as a bolt of pain, that began in his spine and radiated outwards to envelop his entire body, struck him soundlessly. His body dropped instantly, twitching spasmodically. With mounting fear, the blond realised that, whilst his mind was still clear, his body was unable to respond to his frantic commands to run or fight. A terrified whimper escaped from frozen lips as booted feet came into his line of vision.</p><p>"Stupid slut," the dark man huffed. "The effects are only temporary," he added lifting Theophilus easily to drop him on the nearby lab bench. "You'll be able to enjoy us soon enough. Now let's see what we're getting."</p><p>Flicking on the lab lights, Theophilus' exotic form was clear to see. Byran caught the dark man's hand as he reached for a pale thigh. He looked with concern at the tears that leaked from golden eyes radiating fear.</p><p>Wait, Silaff," he advised. "Look at him. He's an off-worlder, too. He may not be a prostitute."</p><p>"What is he then?" Silaff asked impatiently.</p><p>"A companion, a concubine? Who knows the minds or customs of off-worlders? I have no desire to touch him. I thought we were to find one of our kind here."</p><p>"You can back off if you want," Silaff said harshly. "I'm hard. I don't care what he is. If he belongs to the lizard, so much the better. We don't need his kind here."</p><p>He reached to push Theophilus' legs apart when a roar of fury rent the air. Before Silaff could react to the sound he was pinned to the floor. A large male straddled his body. He had a mix of darker and lighter hair. Eyes that were like chips of ice bored into Silaff's. Retractable claws now dug into the fragile flesh of his throat. The male was large and powerful, strong and muscular and there was not an ounce of mercy Silaff could behold in the form. An acrid smell arose from his body as he lost bladder control and tiny whimpers of fear were all the sounds he could make as words as cold and deadly as the male that uttered them reached his ears.</p><p>"If you have defiled Theophilus I will tear out your worthless throat."</p><p>Xavier was already at his mate's side. His sensitive tongue flicked around the now shaking form as he scented the air. He could smell and taste his mate's fear, the remnants of his assailants' lust that had been superseded by their fear and the taste of their own earlier loving.</p><p>"We didn't," Byran said. He gazed at a form similar to the one pinning down Silaff. This male had sandy blond hair that reached to the shoulders and eyes that were the colour of a stormy ocean. The size and bulk of the males were almost identical. From the tilting of the blond head and the flare of the nostrils, Byran had the ridiculous notion the man was listening to his heartbeat as he was scenting him.</p><p>"I think this one speaks truthfully, Xavier," he said in a menacing voice.</p><p>"I can find no evidence of an ... assault, Tristam," the reptilian concurred. He wrapped his lab coat around Theophilus' shaking body. "The effect is already wearing off quickly, beloved," he assured softly. "You will be left unharmed."</p><p>"Uist and I can take these to the complex's supervisor," Tristam said as he watched the other powerful male effortlessly haul Silaff to his feet, claws still pricking at the man's throat.</p><p>"No, Tristam," Xavier replied. "I told Eldman repeatedly of the treatment I was subjected to and he brushed it off. I want to make a formal complaint of my treatment as well as that of my bonded mate. I would like to make it in your presence so that it is recorded into Federation annuls to be officially dealt with. Not just handled by some local officiate who will hide it or ignore it. I would be grateful if Uist could protect my mate in our absence."</p><p>Silaff was shoved roughly into Xavier's grasp and the muscular male pressed his face close.</p><p>"You will admit all, omitting nothing. If you attempt to play down in any way your vile assault I will seek retribution personally." He leant a little closer so that Silaff could feel his hot breath. "I promise you will regret it if I do." The cold hard voice left Silaff with no doubt of the big male's sincerity. He made the instant decision that prison on his homeworld was the best and the safest place to be.</p><p>Xavier quickly glanced at the other two members of his 'family'. Sholto had one arm protectively around Theophilus' shoulder, as did Rayner, helping the blond to be able to sit upright. Sholto's auburn curls were caught by the lights in the lab giving the impression of burnished metal. His ocean blue eyes were filled with concern and despite being the smallest of the group, his solid frame offered strength to the slender form he cradled. Rayner's curls were darker and his body slimmer, but the worry in his deep brown eyes matched that of Sholto's. Uist had come to stand protectively in front of the trio of younger men. Xavier knew Theophilus was as loved and safe almost as if he were to remain. He nodded at them before turning to leave with Tristam.</p><p>On returning to the lab, Xavier and Tristam stood silently contemplating the tableau before them. Uist had sat in the large chair with a dressed Theophilus in his lap. His head was tucked under Uist's chin and he was cradled by powerful arms. Sholto sat on one arm of the chair, his head on his husband's shoulder and one arm around Theophilus. Rayner was on the other. He, too, rested his head on Uist's shoulder and his arm grasped Sholto's as though they were forming a barrier to protect the slender blond. Both Tristam and Xavier scented the air. It was heavy with a familiar and heady scent and they realised that Uist had used his own musk to create an air of comfort and familiarity. The low rumbling purr the big male emitted was almost hypnotic in timbre. Xavier smiled at the efforts his family had made to comfort his mate. Neither he nor Tristam could scent any residual fear from the sleeping blond. There was only contentment and peace in the air. He saw Uist slit one eye open, but was sure the cat-man had known of their presence since they first re-entered the lab.</p><p>"Thank you, beloved brother," he said sincerely as Tristam's hand settled on his shoulder.</p><p>"Your mate is as beloved to me as Rayner," Uist said quietly. "As I am Protector of Rayner and as Tristam is Protector of Sholto, we both desire to be Protectors of Theophilus. We had hoped to make this offer before you were called away. We feel it is one that is long overdue. If you would grant us the honour?"<br/></p>Xavier swallowed. He had thought he knew how loved and how much he and his husband were family to this unique group, but the offer to be Protectors made Xavier feel he had underestimated just how loved they were. It was more than a title. Within the culture of PrideHome it was a revered position and one also recognised throughout the Federation. In Xavier's absence Theophilus would be expected to obey and be provided for by his Protectors as if they were his husbands. After a spouse, Protectors were recognised as next of kin. It would be the final link in bonding the group as a family unit. Although, because of his and Theophilus' natural longevity, it was likely they would outlive the others, it meant that the reptilian knew that if anything befell him, his young mate would be loved and cared for."The privilege and honour would be mine and my mate's," Xavier replied.Before anything else could be said, Sholto made a murmur and opened his eyes to regard Xavier and Tristam sleepily. With a smile and kiss for his husband, he stood and enveloped the two men in a tight hug. Tristam responded by placing a kiss on the auburn curls and Xavier rubbed the side of his face against Sholto's.Uist gently nuzzled Rayner's face and the dark haired young man greeted Xavier and Tristam in similar manner and then stood cradled close in Tristam's arms. Finally Uist nuzzled the still sleeping blond."Little one," he whispered. "Wake up, Beautiful. Your husband is here. Go to him."Xavier smiled as sleepy gold eyes sought him out to gaze on him with undisguised adoration. Uist nuzzled again at the blond's temple, but before the lithe man could try and stand, Xavier was at his side. He reached and scooped his mate into his arms."Husband," Theophilus murmured from the sanctuary of strong, loving arms."Are you ready to return home, beloved?" he was asked."Please," Theophilus replied. "Take me home."The other four nodded their emphatic agreements. Tristam pulled Rayner close and led the way out. As their leader he felt some degree of responsibility for what had befallen both members of his team and family. Xavier followed behind him, carrying his mate and ignoring all glances in their direction. Bringing up the rear was Uist who had Sholto almost moulded to his side. His menacing glowers ensuring any inquisitive glances quickly vanished. No-one attempted to approach the men for which Tristam was grateful. All he wanted was himself and those he loved away from the place.*****In their quarters on the Silver Star, Sholto was braced on his hands and knees on their bed. He looked over his shoulder with ocean blue eyes stormy and dilated indicating his desire and arousal. Behind him, his mate pulled his nether cheeks apart and a slick, agile muscle lapped and probed at his entrance. He moaned wantonly, pressing back on the welcome intruder, trying to take it deeper into his body. A low purr created intimate vibrations that stimulated the younger man even more and he panted shallowly.Satisfied with tasting his lover, Uist slid two well-oiled fingers into the tiny opening. With ease he located Sholto's sweet spot and tenderly caressed the small nub to an impassioned cry from his mate. Uist held the sturdy hips still as he added a third finger to ensure his mate was as stretched as possible, the constant litany of moans from Sholto igniting further the bigger male's need to mate. Both men were aware that the almost overwhelming need to couple was born from Theophilus' assault, but it was also an affirmation of their love and commitment."You, Uist," Sholto begged shamelessly. "I need you. Please, be inside me.""I want you, too, my own," Uist growled. He slathered oil onto his member that dripped with its need. He lined himself at the opened and glistening portal and thrust home in one controlled manoeuvre. He held still, listening to Sholto pant as the smaller man's body became accustomed to being so fully filled. A small push back indicated Sholto's readiness and, holding tightly to his mate's hips, Uist began to thrust long and deep into velvet heat. He increased his pace to a primal punishing pace, acknowledging that this was what they needed.Sholto moaned as his husband's hard flesh filled him. He allowed his body to settle then let Uist know he was ready. As the thrusts became faster and harder and raked almost brutally over his sweet spot, Sholto howled his pleasure. A large, strong hand encircled his hot, hard need and fisted it with the same punishing pace.Uist's hand and hips never varied their pistoning rhythm as his mouth moved to the juncture of Sholto's neck and shoulder. He bit down and sucked hard and Sholto's scream of completion rang out. Uist felt the cream pulse over his hand and the tight, slick channel clench and ripple around his hard shaft. It was enough to send the cat-man over the edge. Before Sholto's cry had died away, Uist's roar vibrated the room. His hot seed flowed deep into his mate's beloved body. Uist continued to thrust even when his organ was spent before finally collapsing to the side still intimately joined to his lover. Uist languidly cleansed his hand as he allowed his sated sex to slide from Sholto's snug port. He suckled his mate's drained shaft and lapped up the rich cream from Sholto's body before licking his lips appreciatively, savouring the taste and scent of his satiated younger husband. He gathered the boneless body close, guarding his lover's sleep.Not far away another couple also reaffirmed their loving bond. Rayner lay on his back, his legs spread wide as his husband's tongue laved his erect shaft, down onto his sac and then down to his exposed entrance. Rayner moaned softly as the agile muscle moved to lap up his body before pausing to suckle at one chocolate nub then the other. As Tristam's mouth teased his sensitive breasts, Rayner felt a slick finger slide inside him. Rayner arched into his mate's caresses and his hand wove into Tristam's sandy hair."I love you," he murmured and sighed as a second finger eased inside him. He gasped and writhed as his sweet spot was gently stroked setting stars exploding behind his closed lids. He cried Tristam's name aloud as his erect flesh was enveloped in wet heat as three fingers penetrated him to stretch his slender channel.Finally satisfied his mate was ready Tristam slicked his throbbing shaft and poised himself at the enticing portal. He hooked Rayner's slender legs over his elbows, spreading the younger man wide. As he pressed inside molten heat, Tristam's mouth sought out his lover's, his tongue possessing his mate's mouth as his shaft did his body. As Rayner mewled his pleasure, Tristam purred low and licked and nipped at Rayner's throat and collarbone. His hand wrapped around Rayner's arousal and pumped him in time with the thrusts of his hips. He gazed into liquid chocolate depths that reflected his mate's love and desire. Tristam felt he could drown in the love in the expressive orbs."I love you, angel," Tristam purred. "Come for me, baby," he coaxed. "Come with me," he urged.With a groan Rayner felt his climax gather. Pleasure turned his groin into liquid heat that began to suffuse his body. He arched his back, crying his mate's name as he came, his semen adorning both sweat-sheened bodies."Beautiful, angel," Tristam groaned tightly as his flesh felt the strong contractions that accompanied his lover's release. He thrust for three more heartbeats before he reached his own zenith. Pulse after pulse of his hot seed filled the still spasming channel of his young husband. He muted his roar of satisfaction by sucking hard at Rayner's shoulder as his body shuddered through pleasurable aftershocks of orgasmic bliss.The two spent lovers lay entwined, kissing softly in their post-orgasmic afterglow. Only when Tristam's softening organ slid from Rayner's body did they finally move. Tristam spooned up close behind his smaller mate, holding him tightly, nuzzling at the nape of Rayner's neck."Sleep safe, my angel," Tristam murmured."And you, Tristam. Love you," came the soft reply."Love you, Rayner," Tristam affirmed.In the third living quarters, Xavier was content to have his young husband safe and sleeping in his arms. The big lizard held the slender body close, his tongue occasionally flicking delicately over the sleeping blond, tasting and scenting, reassuring himself Theophilus no longer had the sour taint of fear. His mate appeared to be fully recovered physically, but Xavier wanted to ensure his lover slept nightmare free. As his tongue tasted Theophilus' skin, a slender hand reached to caress Xavier's frill as though seeking to give his own reassurance. Touched deeply by the simple gesture, Xavier tightened his hold and crooned softly to settle Theophilus back into deeper sleep. A soft sigh and wriggle and Theophilus nuzzled into the big, strong body without really wakening. Xavier continued to croon softly for a long time, the vigil a small price to pay to have his mate sleeping without fear.*****When the family reconvened on the bridge of the ship after resting, Tristam announced they were headed for Earth to spend a couple of days with their Papa. Papa was Jameson, the adoptive father of Rayner and Tristam and who had unofficially adopted the rest of the team. He was also the Head of the Elite Security on Earth of which the group were a part. Jameson allowed the group autonomy to select their own cases, refusing to order his sons into danger and had offered to resign his post until the compromise over autonomy was reached. The relationship with Jameson was particularly significant to Theophilus. The treatment he had received at the hands of his own father and the lack of love and affection were now compensated for by the bond that had developed between the two men. Although in Earth years, Theophilus was older than Jameson by a few decades, developmentally the blond was equivalent to a young man just out of his teens. In his turn, Jameson relished the open affection from the young man.That evening was just for 'the boys' as Jameson's wife Aurora had put it. She had fed them and then gone out visiting for the night. Her time with her sons would be the next day. The seven men were in Jameson's 'den'. All of them lounged in loose fitting pants, with Tristam and Uist also shirtless and enjoying the deliberately raised heat. A holographic fire added to the sense of warmth and security and low level music filled the comfortable periods of silence as everyone fully relaxed. Sholto lay stretched across Uist's lap, the cat-man stroking his mate's lightly furred abdomen under a loose fitting top. Rayner lay with his head in Tristam's lap and Xavier lay spooned behind Theophilus on soft cushions on the floor in front of the hologram."I hear you helped contain the plague very effectively, Xavier," Jameson commented. "Although I've yet to be fully and formally briefed." He noted the immediate stiffening postures of his sons and frowned. "What is it, boys?" he asked perplexed."Xavier was victim to xenophobia whilst helping," Tristam said. "In addition, Theophilus was assaulted. We have made a formal complaint regarding the incident. I thought you would already have received it.""Son, I'm sorry," Jameson said the concern evident in his voice. "Are you unhurt?"Theophilus flowed gracefully to his feet and bent to hug the still sitting man."I should have briefed you personally..." Tristam began."It was the fault of no-one here," Theophilus insisted. "I am unhurt. My family arrived before those who sought to could hurt me." Theophilus didn't resist as strong arms reached to pull him to sit cradled in Jameson's arms. He gave a soft sigh of contentment as he laid his head on his Papa's shoulder."You are truly unharmed?" the mature male persisted."Yes, Papa," Theophilus affirmed. "And my husband and brothers have cared well for me."Xavier smiled to see his young husband held as safely as a small child in his father's arms. The pampering would be beneficial to his mate. He moved to lean gently against Jameson's legs and tugged softly at a long, slender limb. Theophilus shifted slightly to allow a leg to drape over Xavier's shoulder. As the reptilian stroked his mate's leg, Theophilus' hand caressed the lizard's frill.As the unpleasant events had been recalled, both Tristam and Uist had instinctively scented the air. Tristam's sense of scent, although enhanced by his genetic modifications, was still less acute than the cat-man's. However, both were satisfied that no obvious pheromones of fear or distress were emanating from their blond brother and so resettled themselves.The conversation was subtly moved to other concerns as Jameson contentedly stroked long golden tresses, a gesture calming for both men. It was still relatively early when Xavier arose."If you don't mind, Papa, my family," the reptilian said to Jameson and the others. "I would take my husband to bed early tonight."Tristam and Uist immediately re-scented the air. At the cat-man's smile, Tristam could guess the nature of the pheromones he was scenting, but that were of a level too subtle for himself to discern.Before Theophilus could rise from his Papa's lap, he was lifted into Xavier's arms and swung round eliciting a peal of musical laughter."Goodnight, Papa, goodnight, my brothers," he giggled breathlessly.Jameson stood and kissed the blond's smooth cheek and patted the reptilian's shoulder. "Sleep well, boys," he said as he settled back into his chair. As the two males left, Jameson waited a few moments before turning anxious eyes to Tristam."He is alright, he wasn't hurt?" he asked."He was shot with a stun ray and shocked and frightened, but we arrived before they could...harm him. Xavier hasn't moved far from his side since."Jameson didn't miss the hesitation in Tristam's words or the implication behind it and he gave a mental prayer of thanks for Theophilus' deliverance."They're both fine, Papa," Uist added. "Trust me," he added with a wink.Jameson blinked and then smiled in understanding.In their room, Xavier had wasted no time in stripping both himself and his mate. Theophilus now lay naked in the sumptuous nest prepared for them and Xavier trilled low and deep as he knelt between spread thighs to encourage the burgeoning erection of the beautiful blond to full hardness. Theophilus' hands stroked the smooth skin of his skull and over the sensitive frill sending ripples of arousal through the big male's body. One hand continued to fondle Xavier's frill whilst the other stroked appreciatively over the strong, smooth chest. Xavier's tail insinuated itself around Theophilus' slender waist as the reptilian braced himself over the lithe body on hands and knees to whisper huskily into a pointed ear:"I would watch you pleasure yourself on my flesh, beloved. Will you give me that joy?""Yes," Theophilus whimpered as he arched towards his mate. He mewled softly as sharp teeth nipped gently at his small nipples before a tongue laved at them. Xavier moved slowly down the slender body relishing every nuance of taste of his husband. The soft tang of small pink nubs, the creamy flavour of the soft abdomen, the sharpness of his mate's hips and the essential muskiness at the root of his lover's desire. Delving lower again, he encountered the sweet taste of his mate's arousal as his dilating channel proclaimed its need. Xavier pressed his tongue in deep, savouring the core of his beloved blond to a musical cry of his name. Oiling his tail it slid in deep as he removed his tongue to lave at the solid, slender rod that rose proudly to evidence Theophilus' yearning. He revelled at the shallow panting and way that Theophilus' head thrashed as his mate lost himself in sexual bliss. He had feared his young husband may have been reluctant to couple and so wanted to ensure that when they finally joined, Theophilus had the greater control.A muted whine of loss accompanied the removal of Xavier's tail which was rapidly replaced by a mewl of need as the bigger male lay and unsheathed his hemipenes. Theophilus had worried he would disappoint Xavier following his assault; that the image of Silaff leering at him may have tainted their lovemaking. However, all that the younger male could see, feel or touch was the man he loved and who completed him. He longed to feel Xavier within him and to have his mate's seed filling him.He moved to straddle the powerful male and Xavier's tail wrapped tightly around his waist, holding him in place. He keened quietly, vocalising his almost desperate need as Xavier carefully positioned his organs at Theophilus' entrance. Xavier's hands then moved to Theophilus' hips as he helped the slender man slide slowly down to sit impaled on Xavier's groin. At the sight of Theophilus with his head thrown back, a look of pure bliss lighting his face as he was fully filled, Xavier's trill was so low as to be a growl of possession. He thrust his hips up and Theophilus gave a cry of pleasure as he began to undulate on the twin lengths. As the couple moved in concert, Theophilus held tight to his mate's tail as it helped him to move up and down the flesh that speared him so intimately. Xavier's sensitive hands teased at the responsive skin around the base of his erection and scratched through the small blond pubic pelt before finally stroking the rod that jutted pink and needy, pre-come seeping continually from the tiny slit.As Theophilus felt his body unravelling as he raced towards imminent climax, he gazed down with naked adoration."I love you, Xavier," he panted."I love you, my heart," Xavier replied.Sensing his mate's impending orgasm, Xavier formed his knots and trilled appreciatively at the wanton moan from his husband as Theophilus' channel was stretched further. Xavier's seed flooded his body and the wet heat filling him so voluptuously tipped Theophilus over the edge. A pearlescent arc fountained to anoint Xavier's hand and chest and the bigger male held tight to the shuddering, convulsing younger man. Xavier watched every second of his mate's sexual surrender as he filled the clenching channel. He rapidly licked his hand clean as Theophilus finally sagged fully spent. Xavier then quickly wiped clean his body to allow his satiated mate to lie on his chest, still fused together."I love you so very much," came a soft contented whisper."I love you, beautiful," Xavier replied.He felt the lax weight of his mate as Theophilus gave in to the lassitude that followed the intense lovemaking. Xavier's hands lovingly ran over the now sleeping younger man. With a groan he felt a secondary spurting of his seed. Finally spent, he allowed his knots to dissipate and as his hemipenes withdrew to re-sheath, he felt wetness seep from his beloved's body. Carefully laying the blond on his side, Xavier lapped at his mate's small portal, tasting the sharpness of his seed combined with the sweet musk of Theophilus. Theophilus sighed softly in his sleep but didn't awaken. Satisfied he had cleansed away any excess that might make his mate uncomfortable, Xavier repositioned his lover across his chest. He allowed himself to drift slowly into sleep, surrounded by his mate's scent and taste and warm weight as well as the rhythmic cadence of the beloved heartbeat.*********The next day Theophilus and Sholto helped Aurora in the kitchen and Rayner sat talking at his Papa's knee. Uist, Tristam and Xavier were in deep discussion over the arrangements necessary before leaving for PrideHome to undertake the ritual for Tristam and Uist to become Theophilus' Protectors. Jameson smiled as he stroked Rayner's dark curls and heard the arrangements mulled over. Uist had already contacted his familial pride and they were delighted that the exotic blond was to become a part of their family and, by default, his reptilian husband. Uist had left the local arrangements to be handled by his sire and a younger sibling, confident everything would be ready on their arrival.<br/>A soft buzzing indicated a private call was awaiting Jameson. Excusing himself from Rayner's presence, the older man slipped from the room. On his return it was obvious his relaxed mood was changed. The senior male made no reference to the call and none of his family questioned him. They were well aware that Jameson would discuss whatever was necessary in his own time. Apart from the call, the rest of the day passed happily and the group relished the peace and comfort of simply being family.It wasn't until Aurora retired to bed that Jameson finally spoke about his call."I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, boys, but I've had a call specifically requesting you for a mission. It would mean working closely with a local planetary delegation from Wraithe. Wraithe has been fluctuating between remaining part of the Federation and allying itself with a group of more hostile worlds. They've indicated that the response they receive from the Federation could sway their decision.""You aren't happy, Papa," Tristam observed."This is a border world. You're all aware of how awkward it is to easily patrol them to ensure they meet the Federation's codes of equality, freedom and liberty.""Wraithe had a reputation for slavery and brutality," Sholto provided. "There were the elite caste and the slave caste. Supposedly these castes no longer exist, but as far as can be established, what were slave castes still live in extremes of poverty and most of the work they can get is in some form of servitude.""It's almost impossible because of its location to descend and perform a spot check. Many believe that the planet simply enjoys our protection and subsidies whilst keeping to its old ways. Making sure that when a delegation does visit they see what they need to see.""Smoke and mirrors," growled Uist."Exactly," Jameson nodded. "Many would gladly see Wraithe exiled from the Federation. But because they are a border world, their government ensured they ingratiated themselves with similar. If we refuse to send one of our best teams, the team they have requested assistance from, then the inference is that we have little concern for the smaller border worlds. The planet could easily sow dissent and doubt along the borders.""It seems we have little choice. We have to show equality to all our worlds. Do we know why we were selected? Is it just our reputation?" asked Tristam."As far as I am able to ascertain," Jameson nodded. "The best I can uncover is that the delegation leader: Beckla, has asked for your team. Supposedly she has heard you are one of the top Elite teams and she has stated that if we wish to prove we want to protect border worlds, then we should be prepared to send our best when requested. I have to confess I dislike the woman intensely. I would advise you to be as wary of the delegation that you are supposed to help as you would of any potential predator." "What are we up against?" Uist asked."Wraithe set up a small mining colony on an inhospitable asteroid. They lost contact two weeks ago and immediately put in a request that the Federation send them support to investigate. They claim that pirate raids have been attacking their ships and fear buccaneers have attacked the colony. We have agreed to send a small military force and some mining experts.""Pirate attacks aren't usually something we would be involved in," Rayner observed. "They have also mooted that the pirate attacks are just fronts by another border world. That's what they want us to look into." Jameson explained."A very volatile scenario," Xavier sighed. "The military will want control.""They are in charge of defence, you would be in charge of the investigation and I have also negotiated that the Elite team have overall authority to stay or leave as the situation dictates. This is a very isolated area and communication is poor.""We don't have much choice in this do we, Papa?" Rayner asked quietly as he nuzzled gently against the older man. Jameson drew Rayner into his embrace. "As dark haired, of slender build, of smaller stature or simply being of another race, you all would be seen as substandard. Theophilus would make an exotic...pet." He moved to include Theophilus in his hug. "They favour the physically strong, tall and blond," He managed to include Sholto, sheltering all of them in a loving hold. Jameson's grip tightened as the blond buried his face in the mature male's shoulder "They would be impressed with the power of you, Tristam, and Uist although an off-worlder. Xavier would be something to avoid, not attractive enough to be a pet." He tenderly kissed each of the boys he held. Theophilus' chronological age was immaterial to Jameson. To him, Theophilus would always be one of his 'boys' just as Xavier was. "Go to your husbands, my sons," he said releasing the trio from the safety of his arms to that of their mates. "Think about it hard and well. I will see you all tomorrow." He kissed the other three males before leaving.As Jameson left the room, three thoughtful couples sat in contemplative silence.It was almost a foregone conclusion that Tristam accepted the mission. Through Jameson he contacted the major in charge of the military team. Derrick was known to the group and was amicable to Tristam's recommendations. It was established that Tristam's team would make the preliminary sweep and initial investigations whilst the military secured the camp and the mining team made their checks. If any protracted work was necessary, Tristam had the right to call in any other Elite groups he deemed essential or he could choose to relinquish the investigation to another team. It had not been easy to negotiate the latter. Beckla proved difficult to agree the terms with, but eventually conceded. Tristam was more than half convinced that the reason for their selection was the woman was still entrenched in Wraithe's old mind-set. Anything less than the best would be seen as substandard which was not acceptable to a Wraithe denizen of the supposedly discontinued elite caste.********The six moved as one towards their first face-to-face meeting with Beckla and her team, Derrick's platoon and the miners. Tristam had already spoken to the miners' leader Kaz and was impressed by his quiet intelligence. As they entered the room, the silence was almost palpable. Beckla stood aside from the others, her group behind her. Tristam had been appraised that she was a physician and that her group included medical technicians amongst other less defined personnel. However, he was still unprepared for the sight they made. Beckla herself was easily six feet or more tall. She was powerfully built with short-cropped platinum blonde hair. Her pale blue eyes lit up as she ran them over his and Uist's forms. Tristam was aware of the almost sub-vocal growl from Uist. Beckla's team were all tall, powerfully built blond males. Tristam noticed the lascivious looks directed at Theophilus. If he had held any doubt as to Jameson's meaning of the word 'pet', they vanished under the openly leering looks. Uist's growl intensified as Beckla approached. Tristam's sense of scent was enhanced, but Uist's was keener still. However, as Beckla drew nearer, the unmistakeable scent of arousal assaulted Tristam's nose."I am Beckla," the woman announced curtly. "Group Leader." She ran her eyes over Tristam and Uist, lingering on the body of the cat-man to Tristam's side. "I am pleased to see two such excellent males," she continued. "I have never been so close to a PrideHomer. They are indeed all I have heard they were purported to be." She reached out a hand as if to touch Uist's chest."I am Tristam, Elite Leader." Tristam moved to intercept the hand even as Uist's warning growl was heard. "Uist is Second-in -Command. We are both mated." He drew Rayner to his left arm as Uist drew Sholto to his right. "Rayner and Sholto," he said as the younger men took their places. "My final team members are Theophilus and Xavier, also mated." As he spoke, Theophilus moved to stand between him and Uist with Xavier behind. It was Tristam's intention to show they were a single cohesive group. "If at any time you or a member of your group treats any of my people with less than the equality and respect they deserve, we will withdraw from the investigation.""You mated with Betas," Beckla sneered curling her thin lips. "Male Betas. A waste of your potential. You choose to consort with sub-species," her look was contemptuous and then she gave a cold smile. "However, I have been assured your team is the best. That is what we desire." As she spoke her last word, her gaze returned to Uist. She stared pointedly at his groin and deliberately licked her lips.Uist was disgusted by the blatant sexual display. He had been announced as mated and he pulled Sholto tight to his side. Such a display on PrideHome would not have gone unchallenged, but here he deferred to Tristam's judgement. He felt a hand press reassuringly at the small of his back. He feasted his eyes on the beauty of his mate and inhaled his scent deeply. He then faced Beckla with the coldest stare he possessed. For a fleeting second, he saw the anger and revulsion as her gaze flicked briefly to the auburn haired smaller man and then the mask was back in place. Beckla turned away, a malevolent smile on her face. She hissed at her group, but neither Tristam nor Uist were able to make out the words. Instinctively he and Uist glanced at each other. Pulling their mates tighter to their sides, they moved simultaneously closer to Theophilus. Picking up on the undercurrent, Xavier moulded his large frame behind Theophilus. As Beckla turned round she took in the silent message, however, the cold smile remained frozen in place.The teams travelled on a large military ship that was sufficiently large to house "Silver Star". There were extra soldiers to pilot the huge craft, but these would not be leaving the Mother ship. Tristam's group got to know the platoon of soldiers under Derrick's command. Derrick was a powerfully built man, with dark black skin and a shaved skull. The Sergeant was Myla, an athletically built woman with close-cropped brunette hair and there were six other soldiers: one female and five male. Kaz had three mining experts with him, all male. Despite their divergent backgrounds they were all comfortable with each others presences. Beckla and her group remained resolutely aloof. The others had quickly discerned that ignoring Beckla and her people was the best way of dealing with them.Due to an imminent meteor storm, those landing were forced to do so at the equivalent of the middle of the night. The storm was likely to last a couple of days. It also meant that ship to shore communication would be impossible. Tristam took his people down in "Silver Star" wanting its wealth of equipment to hand in case of emergency. The rest descended in a basic military transport shuttle. On landing, Beckla led them to the miners' barracks. "We would be best to stay here now and begin to unravel the mystery after resting," Beckla announced. "Our scanners show no life, so there is no urgency. I am taking my people to the Med Labs where we will rest."No-one argued as she left. In truth, the others were glad not to be in too close company with her group. Beckla's men had not spoken to anyone, only leered at Theophilus and at the women, irritating everyone.**************As the equivalent of morning dawned, Beckla came to provide schematics of the mine and the building and to agree the arrangements of who investigated what. Kaz and his three men went with two of Beckla's men and one military escort. Theophilus and Rayner wanted to check communications and again were assigned two of Beckla's men and Myla as military escort. Uist and Sholto went to simply allow Uist to use his finely tuned senses to try and pick up anything that would explain the apparent disappearance of the miners. They also had two of Beckla's men, but eschewed a military escort. Tristam and Xavier opted to remain at the barracks to examine schematics. Derrick and two men decided to check the rest of the facility, leaving the rest of the platoon with Tristam and Xavier. As the people went about their various tasks, Tristam was unable to suppress a shiver. Xavier glanced over."What is it, my brother?" he asked."I can't explain it, Xavier," Tristam replied. "But something here feels very wrong. It went against all of my instincts to trust Beckla and her people.""That is very bad," Xavier murmured. "Your instincts are impeccable.""Let us look at those schematics again. I have some ideas about defence."***********Rayner and Theophilus were uncomfortable in the presence of Beckla's men. The large blonds were constantly trying to pet Theophilus and laughing at his evasions. Rayner glowered at them, but received only further laughter for his attempt. It suddenly struck Rayner what it was that seemed so wrong. These men were making no attempt to locate missing miners. They were relaxed, as though they were at home. They were not concerned that men had apparently ceased contact and disappeared. He glanced at Theophilus and could see his brother of the heart was thinking along the same lines as Theophilus' hand slid towards the knife he wore concealed at his thigh. There was a sudden flurry of movement and Myla dropped unconscious to the floor. "Not so fast, pretty," one of the two men growled. A small gun's muzzle was pressed against Rayner's temple and the sidearms he and Theophilus carried were removed. A third man appeared and slung the unconscious woman over his shoulder taking her in a different direction as the hands of the dark and blond men were bound behind their backs and they were ushered towards another section of the complex. Theophilus and Rayner were taken to an empty room in the medical facility and Rayner was shoved roughly to the floor by the far wall. "Let him be!" Rayner shouted as the men enjoyed pawing and groping at Theophilus. "It's a shame about this little toy," one man said as his hands traced the outline of Theophilus' sex through his leggings. "We should have been able to keep him as a plaything.""Beckla wants all the Betas dead. Her way of regaining her pride after the rejection of the cat-man. She intends for him to know that she killed them to teach him a lesson."Tiring of their games with Theophilus, they shoved him to the floor next to Rayner. They glanced around as a third man entered. Rayner's eyes were drawn hypnotically to the ...pouch...he held. Some form of egg sac and it was moving. Rayner could see... things... inside, about the size of kittens and his mouth went dry with fear."Feeding time for Beckla's babies," the third man laughed as the first two left. He threw the writhing, slimy bundle to the floor just feet away from the bound young men.Theophilus had his back to whatever landed so closely with a wet squelching noise and he didn't want to speculate on what they faced. They were bound and helpless and from the look on Rayner's face he was glad he couldn't see behind him."Rayner, press yourself against the wall," he urged.Breaking his horrified gaze from the writhing sac, Rayner manoeuvred himself so his back was hard against the wall. As Theophilus moved closer, Rayner couldn't suppress the whimper of disgust as a slimy insect-like appendage pushed through the rapidly disintegrating sac."What are they?" he whispered."Do not look at them, my brother," Theophilus urged as he blanketed his body over Rayner's. "My constitution is somewhat more hardy than yours. Perhaps I can withstand ... whatever the attack may be.""Theophilus, no," Rayner whispered realising the blond's intent."Remember that I love you, Tristam, Sholto and Uist more than any save Xavier," he kissed Rayner softly on the lips and moved again to try and fully cover the dark slender form with his own. "Tell Xavier my love for him will never fade. Lay very still, my brother."Rayner buried his face in Theophilus' shoulder as chitinous sounds approached. He felt the blond stiffen as the sounds came closer. He couldn't stop his tears as Theophilus' body jerked repeatedly before becoming limp. The golden eyes each leaked a single crystal tear before the light in them dimmed. Rayner gave a mental scream of anguish.>Not dead. Not dead. Not dead< the younger man cried out in his mind as he pressed as close as possible to the unmoving body above him.***********Uist was disgusted with himself. He and his mate had been caught in a simple trap. Sholto had been unconscious when taken from Uist's side. The sight of his helpless mate on a screen in his room was the only thing preventing his escape attempts. He had been warned that Sholto would be killed if he tried to free himself. He lay naked, spread-eagled on a medical bed, his wrists and ankles secured. He glared as Beckla entered his room."If you hurt him in any way, then no power in this universe will prevent me seeking my vengeance on you and that of my pride on yours," Uist growled.You are in no position to threaten me, cat," Beckla said. "By now your other Betas are already providing sustenance to my creations, a suitable punishment for your earlier behaviour. I wanted a PrideHomer from the start of my experiments. Your DNA, for intelligence, speed and strength, would be perfect. Your Federation," she laughed. "So easy, so gullible." Beckla's eyes devoured the powerful, naked form. She reached to Uist's furred genital pouch and pulled free the lax organs. She calmly weighed the full sac before moving to stroke the impressive, limp, penis.Releasing her prize, Beckla pulled apart the coat she wore. The studded fastenings snapped open to display her own nudity. She knew on her world her body was prized for its strength and musculature, but she frowned as the bound male stared at her as though she was one of the lowest of the subspecies of Wraithe. She caressed her breasts, ensuring her red nipples stood erect on the firm white flesh. With a smile devoid of humanity, she moved to straddle the naked body. Her body was hairless and she ran her hands over herself, sighing as she did. She bent forward, licking her lips. Her mouth fastened on one of Uist's prominent nipples, sucking it then biting hard. She repeated the manoeuvre on the other before sliding down the restrained body to suck at the still unresponsive genitals.Uist was filled with revulsion for the woman who violated him. He forced himself to concentrate, filtering out the wet heat that enveloped his sex. He decided not to worry if his flesh became erect. The erection would not be due to any desire or enjoyment on his part. Instead he focused on ensuring that his seed would not flow, nor would he be brought to climax. He centred his thoughts, devoting his energy to controlling his body.Unaware of Uist's ability, Beckla allowed the impressive erection to slip from between her red, swollen lips. She positioned her body over the erect organ and swiftly dropped down, taking it into herself. Immediately she began a mixture of hard riding up and down on the thick shaft and clenching and releasing her inner muscles around it. She relished its hardness inside, angling herself so that it brushed her clitoris, which was sited inside her vagina. She moved rotating her hips and moaning in pleasure as her orgasm built slowly. With an impassioned cry she convulsed around the solid rod still impaling her. Her eyes opened to stare angrily at Uist. It was clear her attempt to make the cat-man climax had not succeeded. Slowly she moved off the still hard penis. She stood at the side of Uist and waited for him to open his eyes. As he did, Beckla grabbed at his sac and squeezed it hard. She smiled as Uist's body arched and the helpless man bit hard on his lower lip to avoid making a sound of pain. Beckla looked at the blood that trickled from the abused flesh. She swiped at it, rubbing over Uist's nipples before licking the nubs clean, savouring the coppery taste.<br/>"I do not need to give you a climax to take your DNA, cat," she said. "However, I will break you and your precious Tristam. You will both be my sex toys and come when I dictate. Perhaps next time, we will have a little time to play this way first."Uist looked at the small innocuous looking device in Beckla's hand. He did not know what it was, but knew it could only be something unpleasant. Beckla positioned the device at Uist's breast. He was unable to prevent a grunt as a surge of electricity passed through his body. He could hear Beckla's cruel laughter as she moved the device over his body: on his other nipple, his sac, pressed against his hidden entrance and finally three rapid bursts along the length of his still erect flesh. He sagged panting, his chest heaving with the exertion. His only consolations were that he had still resisted release and apart from the one sound, had remained silent.Beckla smiled as she watched Uist try to regulate his breathing. She moved away to the door and then returned."Behold the future army of Wraithe," she hissed.Uist gasped as he saw a creature spawned from nightmares. The creature was supported by six multi-jointed, thin legs. The body seemed to have a soft underbelly with a chitinous back. From the insect-like body arose a humanoid torso with two arms ending in three, claw like fingers and with spines at the upper arm. The head atop the torso was devoid of hair. There were three pairs of cold red eyes that seemed to look through Uist. The abomination's mouth was complete with mandibles and a proboscis that unfurled and furled as it tasted the air around it."You could call her my daughter, I call them Spider-Wraithes" Beckla cackled as she refastened her lab coat. "I implanted my superior eggs, genetically modified, in the wombs of inferior caste females. Much as I am doing with the women who came here. So far I cannot conceive more than three spawn in either a natural mother or a host. They are delivered in an egg sac and immediately latch onto live food, to drink its blood before devouring the still living flesh. That is how your Beta will end his life as the other two have done so already.""No!" Uist bellowed, truly afraid for the first time. He strained against the bonds, but their strength held. The thought of his beautiful mate, and the two other beautiful young men he loved, as living food for these creatures was almost too much for him to bear."I am only able to spawn females and they only produce one set of eggs," Beckla said unheeding of Uist's frantic struggles. "With your DNA and that of your compatriot and some of the more suitable males amongst those here I hope to improve them even further. Their limited intelligence needs a little enhancing, too," Beckla muttered as she began to leave the room. She stopped at the doorway and gave Uist a malicious smile. "I couldn't let you see the deaths of Rayner and Theophilus, but you can watch your Beta die." She ordered the creature from the room and closed the door on Uist as he screamed his frustration.A movement on the screen had Uist's eyes moving rapidly to watch. Sholto still lay bound, but was no longer unconscious and was no longer alone. An egg sac had been left beside him and already the spawn were beginning to break free. Uist's own scream matched the silent one of his young husband as miniature versions of the creature Beckla had brought to him latched onto him. As his cry of anguish ended, a red haze descended over Uist's vision.**********The Spider-Wraithe turned at the noise. It inclined its head as it looked at the door. Its orders were very specific. To ensure that the mammalian male it had been shown in the other room did not escape. The door flew open and the Spider-Wraithe scuttled back a few steps. If it had been capable of facial expression, it would have shown confusion. Instead its head rocked from side to side. This was not the male it had been ordered to guard. This was a completely different entity: taller, bulkier, more powerful, covered with thick, dark fur and armed with long, sharp teeth and claws. The Spider-Wraithe took another couple of steps back at the low, feral growl. A new feeling, one the Spider-Wraithe being had no word for, prickled throughout its body.The primitive cat-being that was Uist hissed at its enemy as he scented fear.He lunged.His prey's fangs and claws slid off his dense fur. His own claws failed to penetrate the solid casing of its back, but had found the underbelly to be soft and vulnerable. In addition, the Spider-Wraithe's legs were frail and broke easily under teeth and claws. Slashing furiously as the creature buckled beneath his onslaught, Uist's body became covered with slime and gore. He kept his roar of triumph silent as he ripped apart the flailing Spider-Wraithe. An egg sac was pulled from its dying body and the would-be hatchings crushed. Satisfied his enemy was dead; Uist located his mate in the adjoining room. Snarling furiously, he attacked the hatchlings on Sholto's motionless body, shredding and crushing them with unrestrained ferocity.He opened a wall-mounted ventilator's hatch and left the grille lying on the floor. He then prised open one of the metal plates on the floor. Beneath the plate was a small crawl space. Tenderly, whining his distress softly, he gathered Sholto's inert body in his arms. He nuzzled the pale face before tucking the smaller man securely to his side. As he slipped into the crawl space, Uist was careful to replace the metal plate to ensure this was not recognized by his other enemies as his escape route. As he began to move, his nostrils flared. He recognized familiar scents. He whined his distress once again. The taint on his mate was also on these beloved scents. Determinedly, Uist began to move towards perceived safety.******Since their brothers and compatriots on the mission had left, Tristam and Xavier and those remaining with them had worked hard. They had secured the area to keep an escape route back to their ships and the barracks area was now a stronghold for them to repel attackers. Tristam's unease grew as time passed. The soldiers had acted on his instruction even though he had no evidence other than instinct that something was wrong and they were in great danger.Xavier whirled at the scream from Tristam and he raced to where his brother and commander now knelt, hands gripping tightly to his head."Rayner," Tristam gasped in response to the query from the reptilian. "Help me."Between them, Tristam and Xavier pulled a metal floor plate clear."Take care," Xavier said grasping Tristam's arm in a gesture of assurance.As he crawled, Tristam extended his hearing, filtering out other noises to get a physical location on his stricken mate. Their psychic link was full of pain and confusion. With relief, he found Rayner's precious rhythm; however, his joy at finding that of his mate was tempered by what else he could hear. With a choked cry, Tristam tried to move even faster.Tristam carefully pushed the metal plate above him clear. He peered cautiously through the small gap. He fought down bile as he saw three hatchlings attached to Theophilus' body. He moved swiftly, pulling them from the inert form and using his small laser to destroy them. As he carefully eased Theophilus' body over, he gazed into the glazed eyes of his shocked lover. Tenderly cradling Theophilus with one arm, Tristam stroked Rayner's tear-streaked cheek and let his mind reach out to the younger man. He gave a sigh of relief as Rayner's eyes lost their vacant stare and focused on him. As they did, new tears fell."I can't feel his heartbeat," Rayner's voice was that of a small lost child. "He tried to protect me.""He's still alive, Rayner. I need to get you both out of here quickly. Can you manage if I tend to Theophilus?" As he spoke, Tristam was releasing his husband and as Rayner's arms were freed, their mouths met in a hard kiss."I'll manage," Rayner said."You go first, angel," Tristam directed. "I'll tap your leg to indicate when you need to turn.As Tristam pulled Theophilus close, the sound of the metal plate was the last they made.As Rayner began to pull himself out of the crawlspace, Xavier's strong arms pulled him up and into a loving embrace. Rayner's tears fell again at the muted sound of grief from the reptilian at the sight of Theophilus, limp and preternaturally pale. He and Tristam moved to stand beside the distraught male as he began to examine the almost lifeless body. Rayner explained the little he knew as Xavier's hands moved to begin injecting Theophilus with a small dose of nanobots."His lifesigns are ...erratic," Xavier confessed, worry in the normally confident voice. "He needs better facilities."A commotion behind them had them whirling round."No!' Tristam bellowed as soldiers' laser rifles aimed at the emerging figure.Uist had mostly resumed his normal form, the fur being the last to fully dissipate and it was this that caused the soldiers to look with confusion at Tristam."It's Uist," he assured. "He's obviously been in combat." Tristam groaned his grief as he saw the limp form in Uist's arms. Two of his beloved family were badly hurt and Tristam felt his grief as a physical pain of his own.Uist carried Sholto to where Xavier stood by the unconscious Theophilus. As the cat-man laid his precious bundle down, a choked sound of sorrow broke free as he saw the blond. A large hand, one that had so recently rendered fragile flesh, reached to tenderly caress the too pale face."Is there anything you can tell us that might help?" Tristam asked quietly as Uist hugged both him and Rayner.Xavier listened as he tended to Sholto. His anger growing as he listened to the violation of his brother and team-mate and to the creation of the things that had so hurt his husband and the human that was so dear to him."As best I can tell, the venom in their bodies is designed to keep them alive, but unresponsive. The wounds are filled with unidentified substances that are inhibiting even the nanobots from achieving healing. That can be overcome by increasing the dosages, but I cannot do that until aboard 'Silver'. Ideally, I need one of those hatchlings alive to try and break down the components of its venom to create an anti-serum for our husbands," Xavier said at the conclusion of Uist's tale."But Theophilus is so much worse," whispered Rayner."You are not to blame," Xavier said pulling the young human tight to his chest. "I have often pointed out something of my beloved's constitution that made him more resilient than you or Sholto. He acted out of love, a selfless act that, had the positions been reversed, I know you would have undertaken yourself. As any of us here would have undertaken for another. He will not want you to regret his action. It means that four of us are fit and able to destroy this nest of evil.""I can't just leave without trying to save some of those taken. I can do that whilst ensuring this place is razed to the ground," Tristam said.He led his group to the last of Derrick's platoon and explained what they were up against and what it was that he had in mind.*********Rayner's eyes glittered with tears he fought not to shed. He hugged Uist tightly, followed by Xavier. As they turned, he was pulled to a solid chest and burrowed into his husband's embrace. Xavier and Uist had already said their farewells to their young husbands, even though they remained unconscious and unresponsive."You know how much I love you," Tristam said. "With my body, heart and soul. I would crawl through Hell to return to your side and I know the same to be true of Uist and Xavier. Get to 'Silver' with our fallen. Niall will rig the military shuttle to self-destruct. We will plant the mining explosives Kaz brought as we try and rescue any that can be saved. As soon as we get back, 'Silver' must be ready for immediate lift off. If anything goes wrong... you will know.""You are my heart and soul," whispered Rayner. "There is no life for me without you. Come back safe to me." He kissed his mate with all the passion and strength he possessed.Their training then took over, each man moving to undertake their individual responsibilities.************Rayner successfully ensconced Theophilus and Sholto in 'Silver's' medical facility. As directed by Xavier, he gave them a second and more powerful dose of nanobots and expertly attached Theophilus to the Intensive Care system that began to work with the blond's weakening body to stabilize him. A blast of pain from his psychic link had him heading out of 'Silver' at speed. He gave his orders about lifting off to 'Silver's' Artificial Intelligence computer and ordered a pair of soldiers to act as sentries to protect the ship as he dashed back into the complex.He used his link to find his way to his husband. Ahead of him was Beckla. She had two of her men as well as a couple of her Spider- Wraithes. He listened as she goaded his friends and family."See this?" Beckla asked holding up a slender phial in which was an amber fluid. "It is all that is left of the anti-venom for my children's poison. Do you imagine that your Betas will live without it, cat, lizard? They won't. They'll die. Slowly, painfully, even though you won't be able to see or hear their pain. Inside they will scream in agony for the blessed release of death."Rayner wasn't sure he believed everything the woman said, but he had no intention of letting her destroy or escape with the phial. Xavier needed to examine it. Opening his link to Tristam, Rayner fired at Beckla's men.Beckla screamed in fury as her men fell. Her Spider-Wraithes, with their limited intelligence, were already programmed to attack Tristam's group and defend her. A new attack would confuse them and it would take too much time for her to re-programme them. The decision, however, was taken out of her hands. At the hiatus of firepower, Tristam, Uist and Xavier all powered forward to tackle her creations. Rayner could see a few people behind them; the dark skin of Derrick and the red hair of Kaz catching his eye. As Beckla turned to flee, he tackled her to the ground, trying to wrest the precious phial from her grip.In the melee, his gun was kicked from his reach; however, Rayner had been reluctant to use it in case the phial was damaged. As man and woman circled each other, Rayner kept his face neutral as a supercilious smirk spread across Beckla's face."Do you really think you can better me, Beta?" she asked laughing. However, her amusement fell as the two engaged in a flurry of hard and fast kicks and punches. Beckla's face reflected her shock that what she considered an inferior was able to match her. Both of them had landed hard blows and blood trickled on each face as they stood panting. With a shriek of fury she flung the phial from her, hurtling it towards the floor.Rayner reacted instantly, his reflexes exceptional. He dived to the floor, sliding along the unforgiving metal, hands outstretched. He caught the vital container before it could shatter. He heard Beckla shriek at him and peripherally saw her heading towards him. As he began to rise to try and defend himself and his prize, he saw her jerk back and rise in the air. He turned away, the phial clutched to his chest.Beckla shrieked her fury as the phial failed to be destroyed. She ran towards the young human lying on the floor. She felt something coil around her neck and she was lifted in the air. She realized the coils were alive and she tried to prise them from her throat as they began to tighten; cutting off her air supply and crushing flesh and blood. As she began to lose her fight for life, she heard a sibilant voice thick with loathing."For my beloved mate Theophilus," Xavier allowed the lifeless body to fall from the coils of his tail. "May you find no peace in death," he added as he moved towards Rayner.Strong arms wrapped around Rayner and he gazed with love and relief at the bloodied visage of his husband."'Silver's' ready," Rayner smiled and as Uist joined them he added, "I have the phial."From the safety of 'Silver', the survivors watched grimly as the mining bombs and the military shuttle detonated. Of those taken by Beckla and her people, only Derrick, Kaz and one male soldier could be saved. Rayner didn't care to discover what had happened to the miners and the others. He already had enough of an idea.Once 'Silver' was aboard the military Mother ship an immediate encoded signal went out to the Elite forces that Tristam had ensured would be nearby. The powerful ship's weaponry came to bear on the asteroid, leaving it a piece of smouldering rubble. They relayed further messages to the Federation and Tristam knew that the asteroid's destruction would have no repercussions on them or the Federation.********Now that Xavier was aboard 'Silver', Sholto and Theophilus' care and treatment was as good, if not better, than at any hospital in the civilized universe. Rayner assisted as Xavier directed, painfully aware that the reptilian had been training his young husband in healing."This is indeed an anti-venom," Xavier said to everyone's relief. A few more moments passed as the physician made his adjustments to the precious liquid. Then he injected the two pale, still forms that lay side by side.Xavier and Uist remained in sickbay, neither wanting to move far from their stricken husbands. Xavier insisted that Tristam and Rayner get some rest. The ship's AI would advise him of any incoming messages or alerts.As Rayner and Tristam tumbled into their room, clothes were already being ripped from over-tense bodies. They fell onto their bed, arms and legs tangling to each hold the other as tightly as possible."I need you in me," Rayner begged. "Join with me, please."It was not the time for slow and sweet. Each man needed this most basic of connection to know that they were both alive and safe. Tristam's kisses were hard and possessive as he reached between his lover's spread legs to Rayner's hidden opening. His fingers thrust greedily inside the smaller man, coating and stretching, readying them for their union. He guided Rayner's legs around his waist as he surged forward.Rayner cried out his husband's name as he was breached. Using his heels against Tristam's powerful buttocks, he urged the bigger man to move. His arms held tight around the broad back and their tongues thrust in and out of each other's mouths as they moved in concert to give and receive affirmation of love and life. Their psychic link enveloped them in an aura of love and increased the receptiveness of their brain's pleasure centres. Rayner moaned as Tristam's mouth left his to suck hard at a caramel shoulder. He wailed as hard flesh pounded against his hidden spot, bringing him ever closer to sweet oblivion without his own dripping hardness even being touched. Rayner's climax convulsed his body and his clenching channel triggered Tristam's orgasm. As Rayner's seed spread between their sweating, shuddering bodies, Tristam's was buried deep in the body of the man he loved.Satiated and comforted physically, mentally and spiritually, the two men slept so entwined that it was impossible to see where one ended and the other began.********Sholto's recovery was slow, but incrementally the young man recovered to be able to leave sickbay, while Theophilus was still unconscious. Xavier was deeply touched as each of his four brothers sat their own vigil at his mate's side, allowing the reptilian time to sleep and care for his own needs.Xavier relieved Rayner and the dark beauty went to join the others on the Command Deck. Tristam sat in the central chair and Rayner was pulled into his lap and embrace. Uist sat in another of the large, comfortable chairs, Sholto in his lap, the cat-man petting the auburn curls. Although Sholto had been up for nearly two days, he still tired easily and Uist could barely tolerate any separation. Rayner nuzzled into Tristam's shoulder as though he could absorb some of his husband's strength. Once again the young man sent a silent prayer for Theophilus' recovery.<br/>"My brothers," the voice, although soft and weak had the four men leaping to their feet and racing to the Command Deck door. It was the most welcome and beautiful sound they had heard since Sholto's awakening.Cradled safely in his husband's strong arms, Theophilus smiled at his family. He was still pale and frail but his presence, even in Xavier's arms, answered their combined prayers. Caresses and kisses were gently bestowed. At Rayner's tears, Theophilus reached to hold the young man as Xavier added his own crooning to soothe him."I am sorry, but my beloved is too weak to remain out of his bed long," Xavier apologized."Please convey to Papa and Mama that I am recovering," Theophilus whispered as he lost his battle to remain awake.As Xavier carried his sleeping mate to their quarters, four jubilant men resumed their places, ordering the AI to open a communications link to Jameson and Aurora at their home.*********Water cascaded from a waterfall and Sholto allowed it to flow over him, watched by his still protective mate. Uist feasted his eyes on the lightly furred body. He had cradled his young mate since recovering, and they had found pleasure with their hands, but they had not made love. Now he admired the play of muscles and the way Sholto's wet skin glimmered. He had brought his husband here, to a small pool by his Sire's large homestead, before the ceremony to welcome Theophilus to his pride, to become the blond's Protector. The therapeutic qualities of the pool were one consideration, its privacy another.Uist's erection was hard and needy and strained forward from his body as though seeking its true home. He waded towards the younger man, who turned and gasped at the raw need in the bigger man's eyes. Oceanic eyes dropped to take in Uist's state of arousal and Sholto's arms opened in welcome.As arms wrapped around bodies, their erections touched and they shivered in mutual arousal. A small sound escaped Sholto's lips and Uist knew he had to hear it again. He moved his hips in a small thrusting motion and Sholto whimpered in helpless need.Holding Sholto with one strong arm, Uist began to fist the hard flesh of his young husband. He began to squeeze and pull, Sholto remaining upright through Uist's supportive embrace. Uist's fingers fondled the taut shaft, pumping rhythmically, caressing the prominent vein and flicking his thumb over the swollen head. As his touches got stronger, Sholto's soft sounds inflamed the cat-man's own desire. A wail of his name heralded the intense orgasm that wracked the smaller body in Uist's care. Warm liquid spilt over his fingers and as Sholto recovered, panting softly, Uist licked them clean relishing the salty sweet flavour.Uist moved to lean Sholto against a rock ledge and he felt slender fingers fondling his aching flesh. Sholto caressed the insides of powerfully muscled thighs and stroked the hard flesh, red and weeping its need that jutted from the furred groin. Sholto pulled Uist's head to his and they kissed slow and deep, tongues sliding sinuously as his hand continued to stroke."Need to be in you," Uist growled pulling back from the kiss. He retrieved the oil and slid two coated fingers into his mate's heat."Enough," Sholto groaned. "Take me now," he begged as a third finger entered and they rubbed insistently over his sweet spot, encouraging his resurgent arousal to full hardness.Using the rock wall to help support Sholto, the bigger man wrapped his lover's legs around his waist and, bracing himself with a wide stance, lowered Sholto onto his erect shaft. Sholto gave a cry of pleasure and, under the cascading water they made love, joined physically and by their hearts. A subtle shift of Uist's strong hips and Sholto screamed as shock after shock jolted in his depths. Uist purred at the contrast of cool water and the tight heat around his erection.Sholto moaned mindlessly as hard, thick flesh rubbed relentlessly at his prostrate. Pleasured rolled over him in waves as the water flowed over his overheating body. A bite to one of his nipples in concert with a hard thrust and a hand pulling on his erection sent Sholto spiralling into bliss. His arousal reached fever pitch and his legs squeezed brutally around Uist's waist as he erupted in a shattering climax. As his semen jetted between them he felt the hot, wet pulses of Uist's release fill him.Carefully, not yet wanting to lose the intimate connection of their bodies, Uist walked them to the bank and stretched them to lie together on soft foliage. He tucked Sholto against his broad chest, nuzzling contentedly"I love you, my own," he whispered tenderly, kissing Sholto"Love you, Uist. Always."**********Xavier stood looking out over the lake. He and his beloved were in a high tree house on Uist's father's estate. There were another couple of tree houses nearby that homed the others of his family. One entire wall could be raised like a blind to leave the view unimpeded. It was here that Xavier was creating a special, small nest with a comfortable support for his back. He wanted Theophilus to be able to see the glorious sunset as it played over the silver lake. Already hints of pink and gold were appearing. He turned to look at his mate and his breath caught as sunlight played on his husband's curtain of blond hair, turning it to shimmering gold.Theophilus lay on a sumptuous nest of cushions, completely naked. The sun gave his still pale skin a healthy glow. Xavier trilled in pleasure as slender limbs parted to reveal an erect member at Theophilus' groin. The younger male had been too exhausted following his ordeal to consider lovemaking. Xavier was overjoyed to see that the rest and treatment had been successful. His eyes moved to the toned abdomen and his tongue flicked out, tasting the air and Theophilus' arousal."I would have you inside me, filling me with the living proof of your love, my husband," Theophilus whispered.Xavier moved to scoop the slender form into his arms and placed him in the smaller nest. Ensuring his body was securely supported, he set about arranging his beloved blond. Reclining Theophilus against his back, Xavier then hooked pale, smooth limbs to drape over his widespread thighs, opening Theophilus' body. Despite being in the open, there was no danger of being seen and Xavier relished the opportunity to indulge in outdoor lovemaking. His tail slid sensuously up Theophilus' thigh and slid into the already moist portal. As his tail began to coil inside Theophilus' body, the reptilian's hands and mouth moved over the outside. One hand slowly stroked the silk encased steel of his mate's arousal, the other pinched and rolled pink buds, whilst his tongue flicked in and out of his mate's mouth.The younger man mindlessly moaned his pleasure, so many of his erotic zones were simultaneously stimulated. His husband's agile tail pulsed to stretch his dilating channel as the tail tip flicked back and forth over his hidden jewel. His aching shaft was tenderly stroked and when Xavier's tongue did not possess his mouth, sharp teeth bit with precision on his sensitive ears. He mewled softly his need as he felt his mate's hemipenes unsheathe to press into the small of his back. He keened and writhed to indicate his readiness. He felt his body lift, Xavier's tail withdraw and then he was being lowered onto his lover's twin members.As Xavier felt his penises become fully enveloped by the molten depths of Theophilus' sweet body, he began to stroke the rosy rod of his mate faster. He formed his knot, ready to find his release at the same moment as his beloved."Oh, oh, Xavier, yes, now," Theophilus panted. As his seed flowed in a pearlescent arc that glittered with a myriad of colours from the setting sun, Xavier climaxed, his seed flooding the clenching channel.Theophilus smiled as he came back to his senses. Xavier was still buried inside him and the sun was almost set. He purred and reached back to caress Xavier's frill as his husband's hands stroked his stomach."Are you imagining me filled with our child, my husband?" he asked."I was, my sweet. Our children will be the most beautiful Phixia has ever seen. To have you carrying life we created out of our love will be a wondrous thing."The blond did not worry about carrying children. It was a talent of his kind, not commonly known. Even if that were not the case, medical advancements meant that even Sholto and Rayner would, when ready, bear their desired children. Xavier, as their physician, would oversee the whole process. Theophilus looked forward to seeing all their children playing together. He playfully contracted his inner muscles and was rewarded by a deep groan. "Beloved?" came the soft query."You waited long to be able to love me with your body. Fill me, husband."Theophilus shivered pleasurably as he felt Xavier move within him. It took no time for a second pulsing of Xavier's sexes to leave the reptilian at last fully sated."Thank you, beautiful," Xavier whispered, finally allowing his knot to dissipate. "Are you tired?" he asked solicitously."I am sorry, my husband, but I am," Theophilus confessed. "It was a long day, and now I have two strong Protectors and a whole new family who care.""Indeed you do, my love," Xavier said as he carried the drowsy blond back to their proper nest."Sholto told me of a waterfall he and Uist visited today," Theophilus whispered as his eyes closed and he snuggled into a warm embrace. "I would like it if you would take me there tomorrow.""Anything you wish, Theophilus. Sleep now, beloved."Xavier trilled low and soft as his mate's even breathing told him the blond was already asleep. His lips peeled back over his teeth in his unique smile. Uist had told him of the pool and the reptilian was looking forward to taking his young husband there. He cradled the soft, warm body close, settling to enjoy the rest of the sunset, satiated and content.

<p><b>Silver 3: The Monster Inside</b></p><p><i>Pelaam: June 2007.</i></p><p>*</p><p>The twin suns blazed their heat on the figures reclining on soft silvery sand. A cloth canopy had been set up for those whose skins were in danger of burning easily and needed the shade. A powerful male, with eyes as blue as the cloud free sky and hair the colour of both sun-baked and sea-kissed sand, smiled at the smaller form nestled at his side. Their shoulder length auburn curls were turned into myriad hues of red-gold and bronze by the suns. Even the chest hair was lit into a kaleidoscope of colour. The bigger man's eyes devoured the enticing sight of two dusky nubs that peeked shyly from their protective nest. Uist's smile was relaxed and stayed in place as he regarded the man who lay to the other side of his mate Sholto. Even relaxed as now, Tristam's powerful physique was obvious and rivalled that of Uist's own. The normally sandy blond hair had been bleached whiter and the eyes that could go from chips of ice to stormy ocean were locked on the antics of two young men that played in the warm, clear waters. Uist's eyes moved seaward.</p><p>One young man's dark curls were now plastered to his head and, even without the benefit of Tristam's enhanced vision, Uist was sure he could see the deep brown eyes glow with joy. The normally honey-tinted skin was becoming a richer hue and the lithe frame radiated health and happiness. The other young male was of a similar height and willowy build, but their waist length blond tresses, almost white from the sun's attentions, were secured in a loose plait. The very pale skin had been carefully oiled with a protective lotion and it glistened as he moved. Uist and Tristam turned simultaneously to smile at each other. The holiday was just what they had needed to relax and enjoy time together without demands from others</p><p>A sudden peal of musical laughter had their attention back to the ocean. Theophilus was now held in the arms of his husband. The powerful reptilian had swum underwater to surprise his mate. Strong, smooth, sea-green arms were around the blond's slim waist, lifting him high as he was spun around. Rayner's laughter could also be heard as Theophilus' tresses came free from their binding creating a rippling waterfall of silken strands in the sunlight. Standing still, the lizard allowed the slender male in his arms to slide down his bulkier body and flicked out his tongue to taste sun and sea, love and laughter.</p><p>Rayner decided it was time to leave the lovers as Theophilus began to nuzzle at Xavier's snout. Returning to the beach he knelt gracefully between Tristam's purposely spread thighs.</p><p>"I think Xavier needs some time alone with Theophilus," he smiled at the man he loved.</p><p>"I think he has a good idea," Tristam replied reaching to stroke a soft, smooth cheek.</p><p>"Mmm, I agree," Rayner husked leaning into the caress.</p><p>"I believe Sholto and I will take a walk into the foliage nearby," Uist purred. "It reminds me of the jungle areas of PrideHome. He picked up a towel and slung it around his shoulders. He then tenderly stroked his lover's cheeks until drowsy oceanic blue eyes met his own more intense gaze and a sleepy smile warmed the cat-man's heart. "Time for a little exercise, my own," he said softly.</p><p>"'K," Sholto murmured. He allowed himself to be pulled to his feet and tucked securely against a powerful body and nestled closer inhaling his mate's clean masculine scent.</p><p>"Take care, my brothers," Tristam said as he watched the couple meander slowly from sight.</p><p>Out in the ocean, Xavier had decided he wanted more than simple splashing in the warm waters. Watching his supple, sleek, glistening husband had aroused the reptilian. He now cradled the lithe form back-to-chest and his large, sensitive hands roamed over and caressed the smooth hairless skin of his mate's chest. He drew circles with his fingers around the small nipples teasingly until plucking gently at them to turn them into alluring, solid pink peaks.</p><p>"Husband," Theophilus whispered, his voice soft, melodic, submissive.</p><p>"Beloved," Xavier replied, seductive, silky, possessive.</p><p>Carefully he reached to divest his lover of the small swimming briefs he wore. The lizard had left his own shorts on the beach before entering the sea. A strong, knowledgeable hand began to caress the shaft that rose eagerly from golden blond curls. Then the bigger male ushered Theophilus into greater depths where they needed to tread water. Xavier's powerful thighs pressed the blond's apart. Smooth flesh teased at his hidden opening, already slick with his own natural lubricant. Xavier's tail slid sinuously inside as Theophilus arched and moaned in his bigger mate's embrace. There was little need for stretching. The blond was relaxed and lubricated and Xavier could wait no longer to be sheathed in wet heat.</p><p>The reptilian's hemipenes probed at Theophilus' entrance as Xavier's tail withdrew. The twin organs, slick with their own pre-come pressed insistently at the blond's pink rosebud and then glided effortlessly to be fully sheathed in searing tightness. Xavier felt his lover try and push back on the flesh impaling him and thrust his hips forward. Mewls and soft, sweet cries spilt from the younger male as his jewel was rubbed insistently by every ebb and flow of his mate's sexes. With a louder cry of his husband's name, Theophilus came, his seed a cloudy haze billowing into the welcoming sea.</p><p>Xavier continued to thrust as Theophilus moaned mindlessly, lost in a sensual haze of pleasure. Xavier's expert touch on his sex reawakened the sated organ, encouraging it to participate fully once again. Xavier's pleasured trilling was so low and deep as to rival Uist's purring and the younger male whimpered as he felt the vibrations throughout his sensitised body. Finally Xavier's body ceased its insistent rocking inside his mate as a prelude to his completion. He formed his knot inside Theophilus as he felt his beloved reach his pinnacle. With a muted roar of Theophilus' name, the lizard's hemipenes surrendered their seed, his release pulsing deep into the willing, lithe body.</p><p>Impaled on his husband's flesh, the warm sea cocooning them, Theophilus doubted if he would notice if they slid beneath the waves. It was a sublime feeling, being so fully filled, being unable to do nothing except accept the pleasure his mate was bestowing upon him and the blond writhed ecstatically. He felt his manhood harden again under his mate's tender ministrations. Then his lover's seed was inside him, wet heat searing him, and he felt voluptuously possessed by his husband. As he felt Xavier's release inside him, it triggered his own. Theophilous went limp, finally fully satiated and he lay trustingly in his lover's strong embrace as the reptilian's knot slowly dissipated. For long minutes they floated, enjoying post-coital intimacy in the arms of the sea.</p><p>On the beach, Tristam and Rayner had begun to kiss and caress as soon as Uist and Sholto had disappeared from sight. Two tiny scraps of cloth that had preserved modesty had quickly been discarded in favour of intimate skin-to-skin contact and the only sounds were those of love and joy. Rayner lay beneath his bigger mate as the older man slowly left open-mouthed kisses up his dark beauty's smooth thighs. He paused to nibble gently on the golden skinned delicacy.</p><p>"Ohh, Tristam," Rayner sighed.</p><p>Tristam smiled as he nuzzled closer to his young husband's need. He gazed predatorily at the column of slender rosy flesh rising from a nest of dark curls. The sunlight caught the trail of desire that had already leaked copiously and Tristam diligently lapped every trace from warm, soft skin. As he took in the red-hued head of his mate's sex he relished the low moan of pleasure. He sucked slowly and fondled the almost hairless sac, rolling and squeezing carefully the precious orbs within.</p><p>Rayner was unable to prevent the primitive sounds of pleasure that rose from him as his mate continued his erotic torture. He looked down at the bigger body kneeling between his spread thighs and opened his legs wider, offering himself to his love. He moaned as hot wet suction worked at his erection. A slick muscle tracing the sensitive underside to then lave over the prominent vein caused Rayner's slender hips to thrust instinctively. A strong arm stopped his movement and Rayner mewled as the older man began to suck in earnest.</p><p>Tristam released his prize to a low whine of distress from his beloved. The older man wanted them to come together and had felt how close his smaller lover had been. He moved to blanket their bodies. Their erections rubbed together to silent music performing a dance as old as time. As their bodies rocked gently Tristam nipped and sucked at the large dark discs of his lover's aureoles before sucking each irresistible nub in turn. Rayner's soft keening and constant writhing fractured the bigger man's control. Drenching a thick digit with oil he reached between wide-flung legs for the tiny portal hidden within the downy declivity. He inserted his fingers carefully, stretching and coating the grasping, silken walls of the slender channel.</p><p>Removing his fingers, Tristam hooked a long slim leg over his hip as he lined up his engorged shaft with the glistening entrance to his mate's body. He kissed Rayner passionately as he sank into searing tightness. Both men moaned as he came to rest, fully impaling his young lover, the tight sheath rippling its welcome for his hard flesh. They quickly found their rhythm, Rayner lifting his hips to meet every thrust of his big mate. Slow deep thrusts became faster and harder, striking Rayner's sweet spot repeatedly to leave the smaller man thrashing wildly, lost in the sexual maelstrom of his lover's making.</p><p>"I want to hear you scream my name," Tristam purred. "Want us to lose where one of us ends and the other begins. Love you, Rayner,"</p><p>"Love you," the younger man moaned softly.</p><p>The moan became a scream as Tristam fisted the dark beauty's arousal sending Rayner tumbling into completion, his seed coating his lover's hand and their sweat-slick bodies. Intense pleasure swept through the smaller body in wave after wave. Rayner was dimly aware of the low, deep groan of his name as he felt his mate's seed erupt into his body, his clenching channel milking his lover's pulsating flesh. Rayner gave a soft sigh of contentment as Tristam's weight settled over him making him feel even more loved and cherished. They traded slow sweet kisses until Tristam's softened organ finally slipped from its harbour and the older man cradled his lover to his chest.</p><p>Between his own desire to mate and the scent of growing arousal from his chosen family, Uist was achingly hard by the time he and Sholto had moved a discreet distance from the beach. The men weren't shy of nudity around each other, but all preferred to have privacy for lovemaking. He grinned as he found a soft, moss-covered knoll, with wide fern-like fronds above it for shade. He lay down the towel for added softness. They removed their swimwear; Uist then knelt and drew Sholto next to him. As they moved together, they began to kiss and caress. Slowly, Uist guided his smaller mate to lie down before he pulled back to stare possessively at the nude form of his young husband.</p><p>"I'm going to make you purr," Uist promised in a low deep rasp that seemed directly connected to Sholto's hard, leaking organ. The younger man moaned in anticipation, his body trembling with arousal.</p><p>Uist moved to part Sholto's legs widely and lay down thrusting and rotating against Sholto's groin. As he did, he plundered the warm wet cavern of Sholto's mouth, his lover sucking Uist's tongue into his own mouth to suckle. As the kiss ended, Uist growled his approval. He nipped at his mate from throat to collarbone to leave a trail of love bites. His mouth fastened over one cinnamon nub and he sucked and nipped as his fingers tugged and teased at the other to leave the younger man incoherent with need.</p><p>He hovered over the tumescent organ that lay on Sholto's furred abdomen. His tongue licked at the pool of liquid desire. He wished he could mate endlessly with his spouse. He adored the sight, sound, taste, smell and feel of making love with the responsive young man; to fill the willing body with his flesh and his seed, possessing him in the most primal of ways. With a feral grin he enveloped Sholto's shaft to the root, burying his face in the luxurious pubic pelt and inhaling musk and desire.</p><p>Sholto cried out and bucked into hot wet suction. He panted wetly as Uist let him thrust into his voracious maw; the young man's pleasure spiralling outwards from deep in his groin. He felt the rumbling purr from his bigger mate causing ripples around his sensitised shaft. Sholto arched and cried out wordlessly. His hips bucked furiously as he tumbled helplessly towards his release. Finally with a wail of Uist's name, the younger man's cream filled his husband's ravenous mouth, the older man swallowing all that was offered and sucking insistently to ensure not a drop was missed. As Sholto sagged bonelessly, Uist allowed the sated organ to slide from his lips. Sholto whimpered needily at the sight of his mate, kneeling between his legs, licking his lips with slow deliberate swipes of his tongue. His manhood twitched dryly in response to the intense look from Uist's eyes which glowed burnt umber with desire.</p><p>Uist smiled predatorily as Sholto tried to spread himself wider, silently inviting the dominant male to take him. Dark amber eyes devoured the entrance to Sholto's body that their positions now revealed to his ravenous gaze. The big man knew he would need to play his lover's body to perfection to re-arouse Sholto after such an intense orgasm. He loved to fill his young husband as much as Sholto loved to be filled and his flesh throbbed its desire to be in his mate's tight sheath. Oiling a single digit, Uist teased at the tightly furled rosette to soft mewls of encouragement. He circled the puckered flesh before pressing forward and growling softly at the moist heat enveloping his finger. As he slid as second inside, he laved at his mate's furred sac and tugged gently at the hairs on sturdy inner thighs. As a third finger entered, he licked at the filling shaft and began to stroke Sholto's prostate, causing the smaller man to buck and writhe, riding the fingers that delved deeply within his body. As Uist felt his lover push down on the questing digits and thrust up into his mouth, he knew it was time to claim that which was his. He rolled the unresisting body over and guided Sholto onto his hands and knees. He growled with gratification as his lover tried to press back onto his erect flesh. Holding the slender hips firmly, Uist pressed determinedly into the velvet channel. He continued in a controlled thrust until his sac pressed against his mate's as they were fully joined. Keeping one strong hand on Sholto's hip, Uist began to thrust as he reached under the smaller man to keep stroking the resurgent erection.</p><p>Sholto was reduced to incoherent whimpers, stimulated beyond the capacity for any sounds other than those of mind-fracturing pleasure. The large, thick organ that filled him so fully now dragged easily across his sweet spot with every thrust or rotation of his mate's powerful hips. He tried to push back and meet each of the deep thrusts with a movement of his own. He hoped he conveyed with his actions what was beyond his abilities with speech. He relished the breathy growls and purrs from the cat-man, feeling incredibly powerful that it was he that could reduce the bigger male's infamous control to dust. Sholto panted as he threw his head back and felt his lover's teeth bite at his exposed throat. He wanted to be marked and whimpered gratefully as Uist sucked hard to brand him as his.</p><p>Uist could feel how close his lover was to completion. He gave a succession of short feral jabs to Sholto's prostate causing the smaller man to howl and then gave a twist to his mate's engorged flesh. His reward was rhythmic clenching around his own aching need and an outpouring of his lover's essence over his hand. Throwing his own head back, the primal roar of completion from the older male fairly shook the ether around them. Uist blanketed his mate's back thrusting steadily even after the last of his seed had long left his slowly softening rod. As they slowly sank to the floor, Uist heard the sound he desired; part murmur, part sigh and a sound of pure contentment, Sholto's breath vibrated creating a unique purr of satiation. Uist grinned triumphantly.</p><p>Long moment passed as the lovers traded soft kisses and touches to convey the depths of the bond of love they shared. Although he regretted disturbing Sholto, Uist wanted to return to the greater safety of the rest of his family.</p><p>"We should return to our brothers," Uist said to his almost comatose mate. He swept Sholto into his arms and returned to the beach.</p><p>Uist smiled at those of his family still awake. Xavier and Tristam sat, one reading from, the other tapping into, hand held computers. Both of the other alpha males glanced up at Uist's almost silent approach and greeted him with their own smiles. Between powerful bodies lay their sleeping mates. Theophilus lay on his back, his hair casually draped over Xavier's thighs. Rayner lay curled into his side, an arm draped over the slim waist, Tristam's free hand caressing his tanned hip. Uist debated where to lay his precious bundle. He found himself looking into drowsy golden eyes. Wordlessly, Theophilus raised his free arm and with a smile of gratitude, Uist laid his lover at the blond's other side. Before moving away he stroked the satin soft cheek and received a sweet smile. As Sholto was laid down, Theophilus' arm drew him into a shared embrace. The blond's natural sweet scent quickly enticed Sholto to move closer and he mimicked Rayner's position, nestling into Theophilus' side, an arm slung possessively around his waist. Within seconds gold eyes were closed again and the soft sounds of sleeping were the only ones to be heard. Uist stretched out in front of the group, the three sleeping men kept safe between their protective and possessive partners.</p><p>****</p><p>All too soon it was time to leave the stretch of private beach and return to the sumptuous hotel. There were peals of laughter from Sholto and Rayner and more discreet amusement from Uist and Tristam when it was found that although Xavier had been able to recover his shorts from the beach, Theophilus' was now without any swimwear. Pouting adorably to many declarations of apology from his reptilian husband, the lissom blond wrapped a towel sarong-style around slender hips. Finally unable to maintain his pretended annoyance, Theophilus' musical laughter joined that of his brothers. He peppered the snout and thick lips of his lover with kisses to assure the older male he was truly not angry. However, as a punishment to Xavier as well as to Uist and Tristam for failing to show suitable concern, Theophilus declared they could dismantle their cover and carry the beach bags. With his tinkling laughter carrying in the breeze, the three more mature males did as ordered. They laughingly agreed that the look on Theophilus' face when realising his swimwear was lost at sea was well worth their 'punishment'.</p><p>Back at the hotel, Theophilus wanted to return quickly to his room to dress more suitably. As the still giggling males waited by the lifts, they were shocked when another PrideHomer emerged as the doors opened. Unlike the light and dark blond of Uist, this male's colouring was red and black, almost striped in nature and much more closely cropped. Although Uist's eyes could take on an amber colouration, but generally looked blue, the hazel of this male's eyes was such that they gave the impression of a shifting tawny kaleidoscope. The male was easily as well developed physically, a little taller and carried himself with an almost arrogant confidence. He broke into a wide smile, showing strong white teeth at three shocked miens.<br/></p>"Whatever else I expected here it wasn't to be greeted by three such pretty cubs," the deep voice was between a growl and a purr and the tone coloured with amusement."It's rare to see PrideHomers offworld," Sholto ventured. He found himself the object of an almost yellow-eyed stare. He felt a blush stain his cheeks as the flatter nose of the stranger flared to scent him."It would seem I'm not the only PrideHomer here," he rasped."Sholto is mated to a PrideHomer," Rayner supplied, "And Uist is Protector to Theophilus and me."The large male rubbed absently at his throat before gripping Sholto's shoulder.Sholto, I am Lachlan," he announced and preformed the same greeting to the other two men. His eyes raked over Theophilus after his greeting. His smile widened as two protective humans interjected their bodies between himself and his fascination."Theophilus is mated, as am I," Rayner said jutting out his jaw pugnaciously, taking on his husband's role as leader and protector of the small group."Yet your friend cannot be unaware of his beauty, little cub," Lachlan rumbled, his eyes continuing to drink in the attractive male. He wasn't usually given to find males appealing, but this was a rare specimen indeed. However, if he were truthful, the two humans were of an almost equal attraction. "A man may surely look." He took in the pink stain to the exquisite cheeks and wondered at the man who had managed to ensnare such a prize."As long as he makes no attempt to try and take that which belongs to another," Xavier said smoothly as he came to wrap a reassuring arm around his younger mate.Lachlan's eyes widened as he took in the powerful reptilian. Of all the partners that had crossed his mind, a lizard mate hadn't featured. He saw the love in the golden eyes as the blond looked at his lover. He felt a flicker of anger at his own lack of mate. Then he was looking at the other two men. Uist and another male whose look gave him a frisson down his spine. Although appearing human, Lachlan sensed something of PrideHome about him. He watched as the dark human was pulled to his side, the gesture almost identical to that of Uist with Sholto. A gesture of both reassurance and possession and one Lachlan knew well."Lachlan," Uist's voice was little more than a controlled snarl. The normal PrideHome greeting of rubbing cheeks was conspicuous by its absence. The tension in the air became almost palpable and Uist gripped Sholto so tightly that the smaller man winced in pain. Uist's focus was so intense on the newcomer, he barely registered the tiny movement designed to try and release his hold slightly. Uist instinctively scented his lover, seeking the normal reassurance of the beloved bouquet. A low growl of dissatisfaction issued forth instead. Something of Sholto's scent was wrong. Although unsure quite what it was, Uist suddenly found himself needing to take his mate to their room and to reclaim that which was his. He was unaware of the concerned glances from his family at the continued aggression he displayed."No challenge, Uist," Lachlan said holding up his hands, palms outward.The gesture seemed open and submissive, but Tristam wasn't so sure. From his genetically enhanced senses, Tristam could hear the accelerated heartbeat, one denoting excitement. The pheromones he could scent were a mix of exhilaration and pleasure. Lachlan was enjoying this encounter.Striding forward, Uist left his stunned family, pulling Sholto into the lift. As it rose to their floor, the bigger male continued growling softly, unable to find comfort in his mate's scent. His hands roamed imperiously over the slighter form and Sholto made no attempt to resist. He could see his husband was deeply troubled in some way and wanted only to provide clearly needed comfort. Uist found himself becoming more feral as he pulled the unresisting form to their room and pushed him roughly inside. The need to claim and mate was nearly overwhelming. Sholto was almost tossed onto the bed and pulled to his hands and knees. His swimwear torn from his body, he yelped as two fingers scissored forcefully inside his already sensitive channel. Barely able to obey the civilised portion of his brain demanding he use the oil to slick his throbbing erection, Uist plunged inside tight, wet heat and rode his young mate hard and fast.A frantic pumping of Sholto's shaft had the smaller man groaning with a mixture of pleasure and pain at the almost careless treatment. He'd never been taken this roughly before. He jolted forward barely able to remain on all fours as Uist rammed into him. Tears began to form and blur his vision, this wasn't lovemaking. Uist drove into him again and again before Sholto felt the big man's release inside him and the bellow that accompanied Uist's climax. Sholto shuddered his own release but it was with little pleasure. He found himself crushed tight to Uist's body as the older man stretched out, his tears falling silently. He was unaware of those that fell from Uist's eyes as realisation set in, awareness replacing the primal need to mate."I'm sorry, my own," Uist husked as his tears eventually ceased. He turned Sholto carefully and cradled the young man to his chest. "I'm so very sorry, please forgive me?"Sholto gazed into the stricken eyes. He didn't think he'd ever seen his lover look so unsure. He buried his face into the broad chest."Of course. You didn't intend to hurt me did you?" he asked. As the vehement shake of the head he added, "I love you. But are you able to tell me why?" He was stunned to feel the slow shake."Lachlan and I trained together and his presence has unnerved me almost from the start. I was the better scholar, the better student of the disciplines, the better warrior and can link to our antiquity. Lachlan was always well received despite poor marks, little skill, lacking even in the grace and power of a true warrior. He is strong and competent, but no more. One of my mentors saw the effects he had on me and insisted that, as Lachlan's grades were consistently lower, he be sent to another academy. After he'd gone, things returned to normal. Even his tutors seemed surprised with themselves that they had treated him so leniently. I last heard he had graduated, but left our world. Apparently PrideHome was too restrictive and he wanted to see the universe. Once he was gone I put him from my mind.""Till he showed up today," Sholto murmured."Yes, my love," Uist whispered nuzzling into auburn curls. He gave another disgruntled growl. "I felt an overwhelming need to mate with you as though our relationship was some way in jeopardy. But no matter what I should have had better control. I cared little for your pleasure, you who I love more than life itself.""You're still unsettled," Sholto husked. "Shower with me. Perhaps Lachlan's scent lingers on me."The two men showered quickly and efficiently, wanting the comfort of lying together. Sliding beneath cool sheets, Uist wrapped protectively around his mate."I love you, Sholto," he whispered. This time his mate's beloved scent was a balm to his senses."I love you, too. Always," Sholto vowed.Cocooned in love, the exhausted men slept.****All seemed back to normal that evening as the group ate together. Uist was particularly concerned for Sholto's comfort, but his family simply accepted his solicitous attentions equitably. The sudden low growl took everyone by surprise and they glanced up to see what had caused Uist's anger.The man approaching their table was immediately recognisable to Rayner and Sholto from their cultural and linguistic studies. The man had many titles: scientist, adventurer, explorer and was regarded as a very rich, opinionated and intelligent man. However, he was also renowned for his inability to keep an assistant beyond one 'adventure'. Some had left, tight-lipped, others returned injured to be cared for at their employer's expense. Both of these rumoured to have received bounteous levels of payment at the cessation of service. The last category was for those who never returned and whose family were duly compensated. Yet the man's reputation was legend and there were those who would still volunteer to join him on an expedition. He had been out of the public eye for some time, but he seemed in excellent health as he reached the group. Standing a little shorter than Uist or Tristam, the power and confidence he emitted seemed to add inches to his stature. Straight silver-grey hair reached his shoulders and his green eyes held intelligence as well as something indefinable as he looked at the seated group."Tristam, I believe," he said addressing the blond."Professor Denthor," Tristam countered with an incline of his head."Ah, my reputation precedes me as yours does you," he said amicably, his eyes sweeping across the others at the table. "Jameson said I would find you here. A holiday I believe. He thought you might be ... receptive to my proposition.""Indeed?" Tristam replied. He, no more than any of his family, betrayed the thought that Jameson would tell nobody where they were without having spoken to them first. Their Papa was as protective of them as any father and had wanted his sons to relax following their recent ordeals. If Denthor had spoken to Jameson, he hadn't conveyed his intent to seek out the group."I intend to track and film a panthursa," Denthor continued as though suggesting a day's trip to the park for a picnic."Suicidal venture," Uist growled succinctly.Tristam agreed. Panthursas were the largest predator on a small, remote and relatively recently discovered jungle-world that had no developed, sentient life. They stood between seven and eight feet tall and weighed over three hundred pounds. They travelled swiftly on four legs but were able to walk on two. They had immense claws and a maw full of sharp teeth and could scent blood with a similarity to sharks on Earth. The knowledge of them came from one found dead from apparent old age and the remnants of the first team of explorers from the world. Only half of whom returned. Planets like the panthursa home world were only visited for study purposes, no one would attempt to claim or develop it. However, the beast was a natural killing machine and students tended to keep as much distance from them as possible. It was deemed immoral and illegal to try and capture any creature for study. Denthor's tracking method was the only one considered permissible."Not at all," Denthor's voice cut into Tristam's musings. "They, like anything unstudied, are simply an unmeasured quantity. Study leads to knowledge and knowledge to power. It's time we knew more of these beasts. We can have no fear of what we know and understand.""It is an unrivalled killing machine on the world it inhabits. Stun guns have no effect on its neurological system. Once it scents the blood of its prey, nothing deters it from hunting it down," Uist continued. He had made as much of a study of these beasts as possible. PrideHome scientists had wondered if these beasts would one day become sentient."I have been offered a considerable purse," Denthor persisted showing Tristam a card. The blond raised an eyebrow but remained silent as he passed it to his family and then returned it to Denthor. "I have no need of additional wealth," Denthor's voice dropped to a conspiratorial murmur. "The purse is yours for the use of your ship and a couple of your crew to accompany me to the planet. For me the acquisition of knowledge is the most valuable of rewards. As I have had access to all the information garnered on these beasts, I have managed to devise a special stun gun that will ensure we are protected. A simple and temporary senselessness and consequent disorientation to enable us to make our escape if needed. However, I'm certain such measures will be unnecessary.""I will need some time to discuss your proposal with my team," Tristam said, as it seemed Denthor was standing awaiting an immediate response."Excellent," the older man said clapping his hands. He clearly seemed assured that his offer would be accepted. He handed Tristam a slip of paper with his room number inscribed upon it. "I look forward to hearing from you soon."The group watched as he walked away and then turned their attention to Tristam."Imagine the charities that could benefit from such a contribution," Rayner said softly."I would need to establish with Denthor that we are not his employees and that we would have the full and final say over safety. He obeys us or we don't go." Tristam looked at his family. "Would any say 'no' because of the danger?" he asked."I think he is over-simplistic. He cannot have tried his weapon on a live subject. His opinion of himself is incredibly high. We must ensure we are in control not a glory-seeker." Xavier spoke calmly and firmly."It remains a foolhardy venture," Uist opined. "However, the good we could do with the figure he showed us makes me reluctant to vote against."Tristam looked at Theophilus and Sholto who nodded their agreement."Then I will leave Denthor to wait overnight and tell him tomorrow that we take him provided he abides by our decisions in all things, especially safety."****In their room, Xavier made slow sweet love with his beautiful husband. Theophilus had been both tired and somewhat shocked by the events of earlier in the day and his mate had insisted the blond shower and sleep before their meal. Now he was enjoying taking his lover to rapture. His tail thrust desultorily into Theophilus' pink portal, the younger male's arousal ensuring he was both open and lubricated. The talented tip of his tail flicked and rubbed at his husband's hidden gem. One large, smooth hand stroked over his lover's hairless chest, pausing to pinch and roll at reddened nubs that peaked eagerly for his attentions. His other hand rolled the hairless sac between wide-flung legs. His tongue was wrapped around his mate's smooth shaft. He was both squeezing rhythmically and slowly stroking up and down with his long, ridged, agile muscle. His rewards for his diligent ministrations were sweet cries and soft mewls, arching and writhing and intermittent declarations of love and joy from the mammalian male he brought slowly to the precipice of elation. Xavier's only regret was that from his angle, bent over his husband, he was unable to fully see the look of rapture on Theophilus' face as liquid bliss flowed into Xavier's mouth. He trilled low and deep, the vibrations encouraging more of the bittersweet nectar to which he was addicted to pulse into his yearning maw. Finally the blond went limp, the hand caressing at Xavier's aural depressions and frill dropping as though of a weight Theophilus could no longer bear.Xavier moved to lie alongside his love, drawing back his lips in his unique smile at the look of ecstasy that still lingered on his husband's face. He nuzzled at the glistening and swollen lips and Theophilus' mouth opened immediately to grant entry. The blond moaned as he tasted himself on Xavier's tongue."Thank you, my husband," he murmured, as the kiss broke apart to leave him panting softly."It is I that should thank you," Xavier whispered, "for the gift of your love as well as the sharing of your body.""You are my love, the other half of my soul," Theophilus whispered, pressing tender kisses to Xavier's snout."As you are mine," Xavier vowed.Theophilus gazed into his mate's eyes."Do you wish to love me?" he asked."I always love you, beautiful," Xavier husked. "But tonight I wished only to bring you joy. I am quite content.""I love you," Theophilus sighed as he nestled close to his husband's powerful body."Love you," Xavier promised as he stroked warm, soft skin, encouraging his tired lover to sleep. The reptilian relaxed as he listened to Theophilus' breathing, allowing the rhythmic cadence to lull him to his own needed repose.****The trip to the panthursas home world would take several days, especially since Tristam insisted in stopping at Earth on the way to meet with Jameson, having alerted their Papa of what had transpired. From that meeting, he had established that Denthor had made no mention to their Papa of the trip he intended making. Instead he had suggested he was looking for a suitable beneficiary of his purse and knowing the charity work Tristam and his team did, had thought them likely candidates. Jameson added that many eminent scientists, from whom he had made discreet enquiries, had little time for Denthor and his reputation was quite tarnished. His recent books had sold poorly and few called upon him for his scientific input. More than one that Jameson had spoken to had thought this venture was little short of a highly dangerous publicity stunt to revive a flagging career.There was also one more element to Denthor's presence on Silver that gave Tristam cause for concern. Denthor had mentioned he would have a travelling companion, although Tristam's definition was bodyguard: Lachlan. As a consequence of the other PrideHomer's presence on Silver, Uist was particularly unsettled. Even he was beginning to feel on edge, something shared with Xavier, although their mates seemed unaffected by the tension except in regards to worry for their husbands.Things took a turn for the worse on the second day out.Tristam sat in the command chair on the Silver's bridge. Rayner sat at his normal position, checking communications and keeping informed from the ship's Artificial Intelligence of anything that was happening in or around where they would be. To the left of Tristam sat Theophilus who was handling navigation. Lachlan had walked around the bridge expressing an interest in everything and then simply gazing out at the star-dusted space ahead. He had done nothing to alert Tristam until Theophilus' exasperated voice reached his sensitive ears."Will you please desist from standing so close to me? I do not desire you to crowd me so.""You let the others this close to you, pretty cub," Lachlan replied, a hint of amusement in his rumbling tones.Tristam turned to see the way Lachlan was purposely invading the smaller male's space."*They* are my family, *you* are not," Theophilus replied emphatically.Tristam was about to react when Uist powered past him. Tristam hadn't heard the big cat-man arrive, but it was obvious Uist had seen and heard the exchange. However, to Tristam's horrified gaze, Uist shoved Lachlan away and yanked Theophilus to his feet, pulling the smaller man to his chest."Mine," was uttered in a low feral growl before Uist bit hard at Theophilus' shoulder. The blond gave a yelp of pain as red began to seep through the thin fabric of his tunic."Lachlan, return to your room!" Tristam ordered. "Rayner take charge of the bridge, call Sholto if need be." He turned Theophilus to view the damage as the blond stood stunned, still in Uist's embrace. "Follow me!" Tristam ordered to Uist who looked every bit as shocked as Theophilus.Tristam ushered his family towards the sickbay. Uist now clung desperately to Theophilus, the cat-man begging for forgiveness in a constant litany. In his turn the blond held just as tightly, trying to soothe the agitated male with soft melodic crooning. Tristam caught the still shocked golden orbs and tried to convey his own reassurance through an arm that reached around them both. As they entered the medical facility, Xavier looked up in surprise."What is it?" he asked, unsure of who needed his attention."My fault, all my fault," Uist said mournfully as his hand hovered over the injury to Theophilus' shoulder."It was an accident," the slender male insisted as his eyes moved from his husband to his chosen brothers. "It is nothing.""Go remove your tunic, beloved," Xavier said softly realising something was greatly amiss. "You can begin cleansing and I will join you in a moment." He gave his unique smile as the defensive posture in his young husband eased.<br/>"Accident," Theophilus insisted as he kissed Uist's cheek before obeying his mate."I will speak to you later," Tristam whispered into one of Xavier's aural depressions, although fairly certain that his second-in-command wasn't aware of what was going on around him. He received a nod of understanding from the lizard as Tristam ushered Uist from the room. He was, however, then frustrated to find he could elicit nothing from the other male to explain the ferocity of his brother's actions. Uist was incapable of explaining himself. All he could say was he had perceived Lachlan to be a threat to Theophilus and had effectively staked his claim to the blond in an extremely primal way for which he would also seek Xavier's pardon. Tristam watched the bowed head of the cat-man as Uist walked away. He intended to discuss the events with Xavier, but not when he was tending to his hurt mate. Tristam sighed. He hoped nothing else could go wrong.He hoped in vain.The next day Sholto came to the bridge to monitor communications. Tristam could see the normally ebullient young human was tired and drawn and clearly upset although said nothing. He gasped at the furious response to a gentle enquiry as to his health from Theophilus. He saw the shock and sorrow in the golden eyes and the depth of remorse in oceanic orbs."Sorry, Theophilus, I'm so sorry," Sholto muttered rising to his feet and backing to the bridge doors. "I can't stay here, Tristam," he said turning anguished eyes to the man who was both commander and brother.Sholto rushed from the bridge and went to engineering. He felt the hairs on his neck rise, but before he could react a large male body had powered him to the floor. The cat-man's ravenous mouth plundered his ruthlessly, a tongue thrusting inside to possess and claim. As he was kissed breathless, strong hands tore at the cloth barrier to his nudity, exposing him to a famished amber gaze. Sholto tried to speak, to try and communicate, but to no avail. The lack of air as he was kissed and kissed again caused a grey mist to descend and robbed him even further of the ability to resist. Insistent, slick fingers pushed inside him as his mouth was ravished. They teased at his sweet spot causing his arousal to rise as a prelude to long thick flesh breaching his body. He moaned into the demanding mouth as powerful hips drove a rock-hard shaft into his quivering sheath at a punishing pace. Within moments, hot essence flowed into him and a roar echoed throughout the chamber."MINE," Uist bellowed as he came into Sholto's body. Almost immediately, awareness of his actions swamped the cat-man and he pulled out of Sholto's body to a hiss of discomfort from his mate. "Sorry, mine. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.""No, Uist, please," Sholto sobbed as his mate vanished. His untouched erection deflated as his husband ran from him and Sholto knew he could no longer deal with this alone. He tried futilely to pull the remnants of his suit together as he crawled to a ship's intercom and called Tristam.Within minutes strong comforting arms wrapped around him, to carry him from the chamber. He sat, cradled in Tristam's lap, with Rayner hovering anxiously a few feet away. Sholto haltingly explained that from the first day aboard Silver, Uist had avoided him after taking him as roughly in their quarters as he had after their meeting with Lachlan. How he had not returned to their room. How upset and frightened Sholto had become."I don't understand," he sobbed. "Does he still love me?""Of course he does," Tristam said emphatically. There was no possibility that Uist had fallen out of love with his mate. There was something else; the same something that had him and Xavier edgy, but for which he had no name. He hoped the reptilian would be able to supply answers soon. However, his first priority was to see to Sholto, his second to locate Uist."Rayner, take Sholto to our room. I'll find Uist."Rayner led the distraught man to the room he shared with his husband and sat Sholto on the bed. He removed the tattered remnants of Sholto's clothing. He believed it would hinder the smaller man's recovery as it would serve as a reminder of the incident. He tenderly stroked the long auburn tresses from Sholto's tear-stained face."Would you like Theophilus here, too?" he asked and was horrified at the renewed tears."I was horrible to him, Rayner," Sholto cried. "He'll hate me."Deciding their blond brother would not hold on to any kind of anger, especially in the view of Sholto's obvious distress, Rayner called the bridge. Within moments two dark heads lifted as the blond entered. Theophilous hadn't hesitated beyond securing the bridge so only one of his family could enter it and leaving the ship's AI to pilot the craft. Concern for his beloved brother his priority. Without a word, the blond simply wrapped his arms around his brother as Sholto sobbed further apologies. Rayner sat and watched as Theophilus crooned melodically and rocked the upset younger man."It is all right, my brother," he whispered. "I love you.""Love you, Theophilus, you too, Rayner," Sholto added tearfully as he raised an arm and then gave a watery smile as Rayner joined in the hug.Slowly the trio sank to the bed; Sholto holding tightly to the slender blond, his head to Theophilus' chest, Rayner pressed against Sholto's back. Sholto felt loved and comforted and began to relax for the first time in nearly four days. Their arms and legs unconsciously entwined and the three slipped into sleep.Uist was on his knees; his head bowed awaiting the punishment he deserved from the powerful male standing before him. He had injured a much-loved brother, one he had sworn to protect. He had hurt his young husband, more than once. He was a danger to the young men he loved and who were under his Protectorate. He would accept whatever punishment Tristam deemed appropriate and would then request he be placed in solitary confinement until they could establish what was wrong with him. He started as a gentle hand rested on his shoulder."Come with me, Uist," Tristam said softly. "Let us see if Xavier has any answers to this situation."The two men walked slowly to the sickbay, Uist's shoulder slumped with a mixture of sadness and shame. Tristam silent, not wanting to raise Uist's hopes until certain of what Xavier would say.Xavier looked with concern as they entered his sickbay."I am a danger to our young ones," Uist said disconsolately."Come here," Xavier replied. He produced a hypodermic and gave the puzzled cat-man an injection. He waited a moment or two. "Scent Tristam," he ordered softly.Uist frowned but obeyed the command. He scented at the junction of neck and shoulder, just where his own musk glands were situated. His body lost much of his tenseness as the scenting gave him the comfort it normally engendered. He gave a guttural whimper and pressed closer, relishing in the familiar scent, the strange unease passing. He lifted his head and gazed at Xavier with awe."How?" he asked."Your sense of smell is greater than Tristam's. Mine is nearly as acute, but mammalian pheromones affect me less, unless they are those of my mate. I have become sensitised to Theophilus', but would be less likely to react to those of another mammal. That seemed, therefore, to be the most likely way in which you could be badly affected with Tristam and I only marginally discomfited. I have had AI perform a ship's scan down to molecular level and confirmed my hypothesis. The problems you have been suffering from are pheromones at a subliminal level. You are picking them up subconsciously and reacting to them."What pheromones?" Uist asked."Arousal. More specifically, Lachlan's arousal."Uist gave a low dangerous growl, but was stayed by Tristam's hand on his shoulder."Can we demonstrate he has done this deliberately?" Tristam asked."I know of no PrideHomer able to do this at such a microscopic level," Xavier replied. He tilted his head at Uist and received a shake of the cat-man's shaggy head. "That's not to say it isn't deliberate," Xavier added. "The greatest concentrations are on our husbands. He has touched all of us, except you, Uist, yet there are no pheromones on Tristam, Denthor or myself.""When I scented Sholto, it made me more unsettled instead of less and I wanted to take him to make him mine. I knew I'd been rough and was afraid I'd be such again, so I tried to keep away from him," Uist said."By distancing yourself, you desired him more and the subliminal scent of another male's arousal on those you love, especially your own mate, drove you to a primal mating frenzy," Xavier added."So when Uist became aware of his actions because his scent overwhelmed Lachlan's, the circle began again?" Tristam sought confirmation from the reptilian scientist.The lizard nodded."I still betrayed Sholto's trust. I took what was not offered..." Uist began."Did Sholto ever try and stop you? Did he fight you? Or did he accept you needed him but then try and get you to talk to him?" Tristam said. "Your biggest hurt to him was here," the blond said gently as he placed a hand over Uist's heart. "He doesn't understand and his heart aches. Go to him, Uist. Let him know what's happened and show him how much you love him."Uist groaned as he realised the truth of Tristam's words. He had been so consumed with his shame; he'd run from his lover. What must have gone through Sholto's mind to have been roughly taken and then left?"Let us all seek out our mates and assure them of our love," Xavier said gently. "You will need to come back for further injections to keep your system from recognising Lachlan's pheromones, Uist" he added as they moved as one.****Three powerful males stood in silent awe at the tableau before them. Their mates lay sleeping in Tristam's bed and looked completely angelic. Tristam saw the look in Uist's eyes and reached out through his psychic bond to gently awaken his personal sleeping beauty. He smiled as drowsy, dark eyes opened and Rayner carefully disentangled himself to drape at Tristam's side. The movement, as light as it was awoke the lissom blond and he gave an incandescent smile at the nod from his husband. He nuzzled at Sholto's temple."Sholto, your husband needs you," he whispered.Sleepy blue eyes opened and saw the look of love and yearning in his mate's eyes. The haunted look was gone."Please," Uist begged hoarsely and was rewarded by Sholto reaching wordlessly for him. He choked back a cry as he scooped the smaller man to hug tightly as slim arms wrapped desperately around his neck. He gave a soul-deep moan as he scented his beloved and there was no taint marring Sholto's natural fragrance. He heard the soft whimper of need and gave a purr at the burgeoning arousal from the small body."I love you," Sholto whispered."I love you, mine. Let me show you how much." He smiled at the tiny nod and then at his family before striding from the room.As Uist left he heard Tristam and Xavier begin to explain what had happened, but all Uist cared about at that moment was the sweet smelling, trusting, precious bundle in his arms. As he entered their room, he laid his naked lover on their bed. The smaller man was half hard, but his eyes still held a residue of apprehension."Let me love you?" he pleaded. He needed to explain to his lover, but felt they needed to connect on a physical level first."Please love me," Sholto begged.Uist stroked at Sholto's inner legs and inclined his head. Slowly, the lightly furred limbs parted and the bigger man knelt reverently between them. He bent and took his mate's mouth in a gentle exploration. He licked the full lips and darted his tongue into the warm wet cavern beyond to taste his lover's unique sweetness. He kissed down Sholto's throat to root through the soft fur of his young mate's chest. Locating one irresistible cinnamon nub with his teeth, he teased the other with gentle fingers. The tender cries of pleasure from Sholto were all the more joyous to Uist's ears for having been absent during the rougher mating. Reluctantly abandoning the aching peaks, he licked his way down the furred abdomen to sweep desultorily across the small pool of liquid desire, swallowing his lover's tribute to his lovemaking. He slid lower and touched the inner thighs.Sholto's eyes still held a fragment of apprehension and Uist could understand why. Even in the dimness of their quarters, the cat-man was able to see the slight swelling and superficial bruising around his mate's entrance. With butterfly lightness, Uist kissed the small opening and let his tongue lave in a slow circle. As Sholto's moaning intensified, Uist felt the smaller man try and take the slick muscle deeper and pushed his tongue inside the velvet channel. Uist's purr of pleasure vibrated though Sholto's body and the younger man writhed and mewled."Want you, Uist, Please," Sholto begged.Uist had no intention of entering his mate until Xavier had healed Sholto. Instead he swung round and straddled Sholto's chest, his arousal pointing to the younger man's mouth. He yowled as Sholto's wet heat engulfed his sensitive flesh, sucking and licking with a passion that matched Uist's but that the cat-man had striven to keep under firm control. His mate's tongue probing insistently inside the slit on his engorged arousal fractured that control. Purring deeply, he engulfed Sholto to the root, inhaling his mate's sweet smelling musk as he stroked the skin between furred sac and hidden entrance. The action caused Sholto to buck upwards and Uist growled his approval as hard flesh pumped in and out of his eager mouth. A muffled wail heralded the outpouring of his mate's sexual nectar and Uist swallowed it all voraciously. As he devoured the last precious drop, he could no longer deny his own completion and his hot seed flooded Sholto. He felt the smaller man swallow repeatedly before he was finally sated.As Sholto panted, trying to catch his breath, Uist moved to cradle his lover to his chest. He petted at the golden-brown curls and in a quiet voice began to explain recent events as Sholto nested closely.Back in their quarters, Tristam and Rayner also sought to reaffirm their physical connection. They had abstained from anything beyond mutual touching due to Tristam's edginess. Now that the reason was established, Tristam reigned in his sense of smell, so that the subliminal odour was eliminated. Instead he focused on bringing pleasure to Rayner and himself. His dark beauty lay widespread beneath him, sable curls whipping unrestrained as Rayner thrashed in throes of passion. Tristam suckled on one coffee-coloured nipple and then the other, whilst three of his fingers were buried deep in molten heat. Rayner writhed and mewled incoherently at the pleasure that seared him. Tristam made certain his fingers repeatedly caressed Rayner's jewel until his mate was riding him and almost at his pinnacle. Tristam grinned savagely at the whine of distress as he withdrew his fingers and sent a psychic caress to soothe his lover as he re-positioned their bodies."I want you riding me, my love," he crooned, "but not my fingers."Rayner panted harshly as he straddled the bigger body. He swept the oil over the large, thick organ jutting proudly from his mate's nest of red-gold fur. He reached behind himself to press the broad head of Tristam's sex at his prepared entrance. Both men groaned in harmony as Rayner bore down slowly and the first inch of Tristam's rod breached the smaller man. Incrementally, inch-by-inch, Rayner took Tristam inside him, the bigger man resisting his body's demands to thrust upwards into the tight, slick heat. Finally Rayner's weight settled on Tristam's groin and the younger man began to rotate his hips. Gradually he progressed to undulations and then a shallow rise and fall.Tristam's eyes took on a feral glow. As Rayner dropped on to his shaft he began to thrust upwards burying himself deeper in the quivering sheath that grasped him so tightly. His thrusts increased in time with Rayner's movements until the young man was riding his husband hard and fast. Rayner's head tossed to and fro as he lost himself in sexual abandon. Each movement up and down the flesh impaling him struck his sweet spot, his mate's hand stroked his own arousal and the psychic tendrils of love and passion wrapped them in an ever-spiralling ecstasy.With a bellow of Rayner's name, Tristam gripped his lover's hips hard and pulled him down as he simultaneously thrust upwards. His release erupted into the rippling scabbard sending pulse after pulse of wet heat into the slender channel. At the feeling of his mate's seed in his body, Rayner threw back his head and screamed as his own climax thundered unrestrained throughout his body. Tristam licked greedily as drops of liquid passion anointed him as high as his chin. As Rayner convulsed on Tristam's shaft, the spasms within the slender form milked the older man's erection ruthlessly to leave both men fully satiated. Uncaring of the seed cooling on his muscular torso, Tristam tenderly eased the spent young man off his softening shaft and curled his body possessively around him. Rayner craned for the kiss he craved and which Tristam was only too willing to provide and then settled snuggling back against the big, warm body."I love you," he murmured."Love you, angel," Tristam avowed.****The suspicion that Lachlan may have been purposefully spraying his pheromones seemed borne out by the other PrideHomer's surprise that Uist was unaffected by his presence as everyone met. Denthor had gathered them together as he wanted to outline his proposals for what would happen once they were on the planet."Lachlan will accompany me along with a couple of your crew," he addressed Tristam. "We will have my stun guns and I will have recording equipment," the scientist said enthusiastically. "Ideally we will get footage of the panthursa chasing down prey, which would be both exciting as well as valuable footage." Denthor looked at the two young dark males and the blond. He'd already spoken to them and each of the three had been prepared to accompany him."I don't think I'm quite up to making one of the team," Sholto said. He still hadn't fully recovered from the recent strain."Rayner and I are willing to accompany you," Theophilus confirmed."If you go then I go," Uist growled menacingly. "I will not leave you without your own Protector."Tristam and Xavier nodded. With the injections from the reptilian, there was no adverse reaction by Uist to Lachlan and he was the best suited to jungle terrain."Well then," Denthor grinned, "all that's left is for me to collect my gear and down we go."The group made the landing in their shuttle without incident and they left it to take in the beauty of the world around them. The visor worn by the scientist was a complex mix of digital recorder and binoculars picking up all the man saw, both near and far. After a few minutes, they heard a disgruntled huff from Denthor."I need to return to the shuttle. Stay here, Lachlan," He instructed the bigger PrideHomer. "I'll be gone just a couple of minutes."On his return, they moved deeper into lush foliage, Denthor taking digital recordings as they walked. Rayner smiled at the look of delight on Theophilus' face as he examined the local flora. The blond had demonstrated a keen interest in botany, as well as healing, that Xavier had been quick to encourage. They all stopped suddenly as a fearsome cry rent the air."It would appear we have been scented," said Denthor. "I'm glad it has been so quick. I rather thought a group of this size would attract the attention of one quite rapidly." Denthor adjusted the visor he wore to focus on the distance, but the location of the beast remained elusive. "I think a more direct stimulation is now called for," Denthor muttered as he rummaged in his clothing.<br/>Rayner's pained cry had the others whirling in shock. Denthor was re-sheathing a large knife as Rayner held tightly to his shoulder from where blood fell freely, the scientist held his gun in his free hand. Lachlan and Uist had both drawn their weapons, Theophilus moving to hold his injured brother."You have a choice, Lachlan," Denthor said smiling. "Continue in my employ or become panthursa fodder.""Consider this my resignation," the cat-man tried to discharge his gun, but nothing happened."I thought you might prove to have morals and I was correct. I'm afraid the only working weapon here is mine," Denthor said conversationally. "In addition, I have disabled the shuttle so it won't take off, nor can you use shuttle to ship communications. It's just us and the panthursa. Or rather," he added as a bloodcurdling shriek sounded, nearer than the last cry, "you and the panthursa." He ascended a tree and peered down at the group watching their reactions. "I will, of course, re-edit what I film. I will capture your tragic demises and escape by the same fortune that has always dogged my footsteps.""It will be coming after me," Rayner said. "You don't all need to be endangered.""I will not leave you, now move, my brother," Theophilus insisted as he pulled Rayner into a run. Lachlan and Uist both glowered at Denthor through the dense foliage."We will survive," Uist growled furiously."And then we will come for you," Lachlan vowed."Run, little kittens, run," Denthor laughed.Theophilus was urging Rayner to where he could see rock above the trees."They cannot climb, my brother," he said. "Once we are high enough we can await our rescue.""Tristam won't take long," Rayner panted. "He felt my pain even before I reached out to him."The four crashed through foliage into a clearing and quickly assessed the rock face before them. It was quite sheer for eight to ten feet and then more outcrops for hand and foot holds were apparent. Rayner viewed it with a heavy heart. His mountain scaling skills were poor even when he wasn't disabled with an injured shoulder."I will go ahead," Theophilus said reaching to hold onto the rock where Rayner would swear nothing existed. "I will pull Rayner if you can push him," he said to the cat-men.Not for the first time, Rayner rued his lack of climbing skills. Effectively, Uist and Lachlan lifted him for Theophilus to hold until they climbed a little higher and repeated the process. The inhuman shrieks were nearing rapidly and Rayner could feel his heart begin to thunder."Panic is our enemy, little one," Uist growled. "Remain calm, I will not allow it to harm you or our brother.""Nor will I," Lachlan added. "I swear by my standing as a PrideHome Warrior that if by life or death I can protect you I will.""Keep going," Theophilus commanded to the cat-men, his eyes fixed on the beast surging through into the clearing. "I will distract the creature."Not giving either of the bigger men an opportunity to argue, he moved sideways away from the group. He pulled out his knife and, gritting his teeth, drew the blade against his forearm, shaking the limb as his blood flowed. His strategy worked.Almost too well.The huge body swung its attention away from the group to the single prey. The unknown creatures had a scent he did not recognise and his curiosity had been piqued, but then the scent of blood had reached him. This blood sang a song he knew not and was of a sweetness that proved irresistible. All prey ran, but few succeeded in escaping him. The upward ground was not of the kind he could walk on and he roared his anger. Then a different smell had assailed him; another new song and even sweeter scented than the first. This one would not escape him. He drew back his body and sprung, claws extended to catch at the prey's lower limbs.Theophilus gasped as sharp claws raked his heel. If he'd been a fraction slower, they would have imbedded in his calf and he would be panthursa food. He ignored the burning sensation and locked his eyes on the safety of the ledge and what appeared to be a cave mouth his family and Lachlan had reached. It was sufficiently high to avoid even leaps by the creature and wide enough for them all. He ignored the small shelf just above him. He began to move towards them. As he moved higher, a laser cut into the rock above him. He heard the cries of denial from his family as his fingers scrabbled desperately for a hold as he slid down unforgiving stone. He gave a grunt of pain as the foot already injured by the panthursa's claws wedged into rock and then his fingers tightened onto a barely there handhold and his right foot found purchase. He didn't try to move, allowing his body to settle and tried to breathe calmly."Well done, Theophilus," Denthor's hated voice rang from the sanctuary of the trees opposite the small mountain. "How long do you think you can maintain that hold?""Long enough," Theophilus muttered determinedly."Theophilus," Uist's voice reached his ears. "If we distract Denthor...""No, Uist, do not endanger yourselves for me," Theophilus said quickly. "My left foot is caught in the rock, I cannot move. Once I lack strength enough to hold myself against the rock I will fall, but my foot will remain trapped." He sighed, not wanting to continue. He didn't need to, it was obvious. If he lost his grip and remained jammed in the rock by his foot, his ankle would snap, he would be upside down and the distance between him and the panthursa would be reduced by over seven feet. More than close enough for the beast to jump and be able to reach him."We cannot await Tristam arriving," Uist said. "We don't know how long Theophilus can hold or if Denthor will allow him to remain in safety. I will morph and take on the beast. That should prove enough of a distraction for this madman.""I will go with you," Lachlan said. "I may not be able to morph, but I am strong.""Lachlan, whilst Uist changes bind my shoulder tightly. I will get across to Theophilus. If I can hold him till the others arrive...""It is done," Lachlan growled. He tore his tunic to provide the binding Rayner needed and then prepared himself mentally for the challenge ahead.Denthor watched fascinated as Uist's shape shifted. There had always been rumours about PrideHomers and their secret abilities. He rubbed his hands gleefully. Things were turning out even more profitably than he'd anticipated. He spared a quick glance to where Rayner was edging towards the trapped blond. Theophilus was going nowhere, except into waiting panthursa jaws. He decided to ignore what Rayner was doing in favour of the battle before him.Theophilus heard savage sounds and angled his head to see the ledge that had once held his family was now empty. Slender hands caught his wrists in a determined grip and he twisted slightly to see Rayner's pale face looking down from the small shelf he'd ignored earlier."Try to hold on Theophilus," Rayner begged. "Tristam is coming, he's very close. Please try to hold on.""I promise I will try," Theophilus vowed. He tried to ignore the aches in his shoulders, the throbbing of his ankle and the creeping numbness in his fingers. Instead he focused on the look of love and concern in expressive chocolate orbs and held on tight.****Tristam, Xavier and Sholto crashed into the clearing; their guns raised, and witnessed another battle between the beast of PrideHome's past, Lachlan and the panthursa. Three sets of teeth and claws raked and slashed before the two sides broke apart again to glare balefully at each other. Lachlan was clearly near exhaustion and Uist was showing signs that he had been injured. As the three men brought their guns to bear on the great beast, twin cries of fear reached Tristam's ears as a laser shot struck at the mountainside. Looking upward they saw Rayner and Theophilus and Tristam's gasp was echoed by Xavier's"Drop your weapons or your boys will die," Denthor's voice came behind them.Sholto watched Tristam to see which tree the big blond identified as where Denthor was hidden."Theophilus' foot is trapped," Rayner's frightened voice reached Tristam's sensitive ears. "I'm sorry. I was so focussed on keeping hold of him I didn't hear you approach."Tristam flung his gun away and the others copied his action. The loss of his husband and the husband of the man at his side was not acceptable. They would have to find another way to defeat both the beast and the clearly insane adversary hiding in the trees."I'll see if I can reach them, Tristam," Sholto's voice whispered. "Denthor won't be concerned with me climbing the mountain as I'm no danger."Tristam nodded and he and Xavier slowly walked to join Uist and Lachlan.Denthor watched the group split. He grinned like a spoilt child. Sholto would be of little use in a battle against the panthursa, but to watch Tristam and the reptilian would be fascinating. Let the boy join the others. He was particularly interested in the beast Uist had become. That would prove a profitable area of study. He watched avidly as Tristam clearly began to issue orders and rally his men. Denthor hugged himself with excitement. This had turned out so much better than expected.Sholto was as talented as Uist and Theophilus when it came to climbing. He ascended quickly to reach his stricken brothers. He braced himself behind Theophilus, but it was almost immediately apparent he could do nothing to free the blond. Instead he took Theophilus' knife and crawled up alongside an exhausted Rayner. He cut strips of material from his tunic."This is going to hurt, Rayner," he warned, "but I think you are both at the last of your endurance. This is all I can think of.""Do it," Rayner said through gritted teeth. "I will not lose him now."Moving swiftly, Sholto bound the two slender men together at their wrists. It was only just in time, the blond's finger's finally unable to support his weight any longer. "I am going to take care of Denthor," Sholto hissed angrily. He edged away from his brothers and with an agile leap, moved from mountain to tree and vanished from sight.On the ground, Tristam had his men ready for another attack by the panthursa. As the great beast roared its fury, the four men answered it with a bellow of their own. As they converged, Lachlan's claws managed to rake above the beast's eyes, sending blood to impair its vision. Uist's larger claws finally penetrated through the dense fur of the panthursa's shoulder, weakening one front limb. Xavier's tail lashed at the creature's hind limbs, but was unable to take it down. But it was now wounded and more wary and moved back a little from the group."Excellent, gentlemen," Denthor's disembodied voice floated down. "However, I do rather think four on one is too many for my panthursa. I hope to make a study of the primal beast Uist has become so he may remain. My choice was between my disloyal bodyguard and the reptilian as I think I'd like to see you battle the beast, Tristam. But then a battle between a powerful mammal and a determined lizard is equally appealing. Decisions, decisions..."A scream cut off any further taunts and the scientist fell from the tree to land heavily in front of Tristam. Denthor gazed in shock at the knife protruding from his sternum and reached slowly to pull it free. He saw the look on Tristam's face as the blond stepped further away from him and he started to turn, a second scream on his lips. The scream was cut short as the panthursa crushed his skull with one massive swipe.Tristam and the beast locked eyes. The panthursa scented the prey he had taken down. It was like the first new song, but not so sweet, certainly not as sweet at that which had remained so alluringly just out of his reach. However, he'd never been challenged for prey before, nor had he been hurt before. He issued a roar and waited. This time, none came back. His head swung back toward the mountain and low growls reached his ears. So be it. Turning back, the beast's jaws clamped in his prey and he rose to his full height, lifting then carrying the carcass with ease.As it vanished from sight, Sholto dropped from the tree, a look of grim satisfaction on his face."Sometimes the real monster is the one that hides inside," he said looking at the destroyed visor laying crushed in the grass."Take care of Uist," Tristam said to Xavier. "I need to get to Rayner and Theophilus.""I will go with you," Lachlan huffed.The two youthful men were unconscious by the time they were reached. With Sholto's assistance, Tristam and Lachlan were able to free Theophilus' foot, both wincing at the sight of the bone that had penetrated through pale skin. As frail as the blond looked, he had an inner strength that rivalled any of that of the three alpha males aboard Silver. Silently both men acknowledged his feat of endurance. Carefully the injured men were carried to Xavier who began to treat them immediately. Tristam was pleased to see Uist had transformed back and now lay recovering from both the shape-shift and the attack. Sholto dropped to sit on the floor and cradled his husband's head in his lap. As he did, Lachlan dropped to his knees, in the same submissive pose Uist had adopted earlier aboard Silver, before Tristam and the couple."I am truly sorry for my behaviour aboard your ship and for the unsettling effect it had on Uist," Lachlan said. "I am willing to accept any punishment you deem fitting, Uist," he added meeting the blue gaze of the other PrideHomer."I am unable to offer you forgiveness, not for the effect your actions had on me, but for the hurt it caused to those I love. However, you helped me protect those that needed it when it mattered and upheld the Warrior code. As such I do not need to see you punished.""Let's just return to Silver," Tristam said. "Let's get our hurt ones home and we can discuss things when safe."****Once safely ensconced aboard Silver, Tristam left Rayner and Theophilus to rest and heal under the watchful eye of Xavier. He had seen an exhausted Uist be ushered by a protective Sholto towards their quarters and smiled tiredly at the memory as he entered the ship's bridge. He had also sent Lachlan to rest, not wanting to deal with the other man at that time. He would make a report to their Papa, knowing the older man would be waiting for information. He had Xavier's promise that as soon as Rayner began to waken he would be called; although it was more likely their psychic link would alert him of his young husband's return to consciousness. He settled himself in the command chair and issued his instructions to the ships AI.In their quarters, Sholto lovingly stripped his larger mate. The powerful body was bruised, scraped and scratched, but considering the size of the beast he had challenged, Uist was comparatively unscathed. Sholto carefully anointed the worst of the hurts with a soothing, healing salve, the others he intended to give more personal attention. Straddling his lover, Sholto kissed each mark he found from jaw to well-defined pectorals. Here he paused in his mission to pay homage to pink-brown nubs that peaked eagerly under his ministrations and he suckled contently for a moment or two. Reluctantly abandoning the pebbled nipples, he kissed downwards and across the well-defined six-pack that now had several jagged scratches marring the perfect physique. Scuttling to the base of their bed, Sholto began his tender kissing from Uist's feet up to the crease of groin and thigh. His husband's arousal lay hard across his stomach. A silver pool indicated the level of his desire, as did the harsh, ragged breathing from the bigger man. As Sholto laved across the furred sac, Uist bent his legs and spread them for his lover. Kneeling between the wide-flung limbs, Sholto bent low and began to lick at the entrance to Uist's body. Low, soft purrs of pleasure emanated from the cat-man and Sholto applied himself diligently to his mate's needs alternating swipes across the musky aperture with short stabbing thrusts inside. A sharp tug to his hair brought the younger man out of his own haze of pleasure and he gazed into burning amber eyes.As much as Uist was enjoying being pleasured, the older man wanted to pleasure his mate. It took several tugs to Sholto's curls before his lover looked up and Uist felt seared by the look of love in sapphire eyes that had darkened to resemble smouldering jet. Uist rolled their bodies to loom large over his smaller husband. He nipped at the exposed throat, growling his approval as Sholto bared more to the dominant male. Uist suckled hard, Sholto would bear at least one mark of possession when they arose from sleep. He nuzzled at his mate's furred chest, sucking at one irresistible nub then the other until Sholto writhed and mewled beneath him."Please, Uist," he begged. "Don't tease. I need you, I want you, take me."Uist's nostrils flared as he took in the heady scent of his aroused and needy mate. His primitive side silently bellowed its approval. Uist roared aloud as Sholto slid his arms under his knees spreading himself wide, offering himself to the alpha male in a gesture of deliberate vulnerability and conscious submission. The cat-man had every intention of claiming his lover; his beautiful, intelligent, brave young lover. Uist's head dropped and his tongue thrust powerfully into Sholto's body, the unexpected move causing the smaller man to scream and then pant wetly. As Uist moved from wetting, tasting and teasing the tiny puckered opening, Sholto whined his distress and then mewled pleasurably as two slick digits slid into his aching void.As his fingers delved and possessed, Uist's lips and teeth explored and enjoyed. They tasted the sweat-damp throat, feasted on juicy cinnamon nubs, licked at liquid passion pooling at the furred abdomen before finally sucking slowly at the engorged head of Sholto's sex to a low guttural moan. Uist's tongue probed insistently at the tiny slit to encourage more of the salty-sweet milk. As much as Uist wanted to drink more than just the enticing elixir of Sholto's pre-come, the older man knew they were both too tired for extended loveplay. He reached for their oil and, slicking a third finger, quickly and carefully ensured Sholto was ready to be entered. He draped the younger man's calves over his shoulders and surged forward in a carefully measured thrust. His mouth swallowed his mate's cry as the tight muscle was breached and hard, thick flesh burrowed into searing velvet heat. Almost immediately, Uist sent up a hard fast pace, repeatedly pounding his lover's sweet spot and relishing the way the smaller man thrashed in sexual abandon.Lips met, teeth clashed and tongues duelled in a battle neither man could lose. As Sholto panted and gasped between kisses, his bigger mate nipped and sucked at his throat, shoulder and collarbone to leave more marks of passion and possession. Sholto relished the yowl from his lover as he began to tighten and relax his internal muscles trying to drive Uist to completion. He issued his own ululation as a knowledgeable hand reached between their sweat-slick bodies and began to fist his needy flesh hard and fast. They groaned and panted as they each pushed the other closer and closer to their destination and, with a synchronised howl; they both came with an explosive intensity. Sholto moaned wantonly as his lover's liquid heat flooded his body, filling him with the physical evidence of his love. He could hear and feel Uist's purrs in his ear as his clenching channel milked every drop of Uist's precious seed. He felt his own completion pulse repeatedly hot and wet between them until both were fully satiated.Uist carefully rolled their bodies to ensure he didn't crush his replete mate, but made no attempt to withdraw from the intimate connection. Within seconds of his climax, Sholto was sleeping soundly Uist still buried within him and the cat-man simply held his precious bundle safe and close until he too slipped into a healing rest.<br/>****On the bridge, Lachlan came to join Tristam."I wish to apologise to you, Tristam," Lachlan finally said breaking the silence between them. "I have used my ability to sway and to unnerve in ways unbefitting of a true PrideHome Warrior. Uist has shown his right to call himself Warrior in thought, in spirit and in deed. To have hoped for his forgiveness was too much, but that he didn't even call for my punishment was more than I was entitled to expect. It is my intention to return to PrideHome. I hope to re-enter an academy and re-study to be a Warrior and if I don't make it on my merits, then so be it.""That sounds like an admirable intention, Lachlan," Tristam nodded. "I accept your apology in the spirit in which it is offered. Uist is not the type to bear a grudge. Once he is certain of your genuine regret, he, too, will be more accepting."Lachlan nodded silently as no further words were needed. Both men faced the star-dusted expanse that stretched before them as Silver sailed silently to her next adventure.

<p><b>Chapter 4: Darkest before the Dawn</b></p><p>Pelaam: October 2007.</p><p>Xavier lay on his back, powerful legs bent and draped to the sides. He gazed upwards in naked adoration at the beautiful vision astride him. Theophilus straddled him, both of the reptilian's hemipenes buried deep inside his slick heat as the blond raised and lowered himself in a sinuous rocking motion. The long hair was unrestrained and shimmered around the slim form like a golden waterfall, rippling down the pale-skinned, slender back and over the smooth shoulders. His mate's golden eyes were closed in bliss as the younger male sought to pleasure them both. His hands gripped Xavier's thighs, using them for leverage when necessary. Xavier's large, sensitive hand reached to caress the rosy-hued rod that bobbed elegantly in time with Theophilus' movements.</p><p>"So close, my husband," he murmured. "So very, very close."</p><p>"Come for me, beloved," Xavier encouraged, forming his knot. "Let me see your ecstasy." He revelled in the sweet, wordless cries that tumbled from Theophilus' lips. The Dregan's channel was now plugged as a prelude to the lizard's own release and the blond panted softly as the twin lengths rubbed at the hidden jewel inside his body in tandem with his husband's knowing hand stroking his hardness.</p><p>"Xavier!"</p><p>The cry of his name coincided with his mate's seed pulsing in a pearlescent arc to decorate his pale green skin. Theophilus' head dropped backwards as his body trembled in the throes of a powerful orgasm. The sight of his lover was enough to trigger the reptilian's release and he relished the soft whimpers of delight from Theophilus as his hot, thick crème filled the still clenching channel. His trill was low and deep; his frill was a myriad of lilac tones indicating the level of pleasure for the lizard-man. Tenderly, he caught the willowy body as Theophilus finally slumped forward, exhausted and drained from the intense release.</p><p>"Thank you, my husband," he panted. He nestled closer to the big, broad body, his hand reaching to caress the frill to another sound of reptilian enjoyment. "I love you."</p><p>"I love you, beautiful," Xavier assured. Sleep now, beloved. Tomorrow will be a very exhausting day."</p><p>"I can hardly believe I will see some of my people from Drega," Theophilus breathed, a hint of wonder in his melodic tones. "It has been so long."</p><p>"I am sure it will be an unforgettable evening," Xavier smiled, thick lips pulling back over sharp teeth in his unique manner, unaware of how prophetic his words would prove to be.</p><p>As he lay there, cradling his lover in their nest, Xavier reminisced about their newest undertaking. They were heading to Terra II, a small, earth-like planet, but still a long way behind in technology. The complex in which Xavier and Theophilus were to be housed was huge and consisted of hotel accommodation, restaurants and bars, shopping mall, conference suites, theatre and cinema, swimming pools, gymnasium, solarium, even a small hospital, plus more, all under one huge roof. It had its own tiny spaceport. Shuttles ran to and from the complex to the orbiting space-station where off-worlders' ships docked. It was the most prestigious complex the world could offer and yet in some ways was very basic compared to other places the couple had experienced. They were accompanying their 'papa', Jameson, who was the facilitator for a trade negotiation between Drega and Terra II. Xavier knew his husband was both excited and nervous about meeting some of his own people. Even so many years after their union, it was still rare for Dregans to leave their home-world.</p><p>Remembering how he and Theophilus met soon had the reptilian's thoughts turning to his husband's father. Marcellous' reluctant acceptance of his suit and the way his beloved blond had been treated not just then, but as a child, coming into Xavier's mind. His frill became vermillion as the lizard's anger began to seep out.</p><p>A pale hand reached to caress his frill and Theophilus moved restlessly as if aware of his mate's change of mood. Xavier immediately ran his tongue over the pale expanse of Theophilus' throat in a feather-light caress and crooned softly. The actions both de-railed his anger and settled his husband. Theophilus was much attuned to him after their years together. He nuzzled at the gold silk of his beloved's hair, inhaling Theophilus' sweet scent and his heart soared at the soft sigh of pleasure from the still sleeping form. Although he saw no reason to be concerned about the trade conference, Xavier was still glad that the rest of their family would be arriving after them, within a day or so. They had been missed by both his mate and himself. He tightened his grip on the slender body and allowed Theophilus' rhythmic breathing to lull him to sleep.</p><p>****</p><p>Theophilus gazed with awe at the banqueting hall-cum-ballroom. It had been sumptuously decorated in white and gold. Those attending the gala evening had to dress in one or a mixture of the colours. Theophilus wore white leggings and a thin gauzy tunic with a golden edge. His blond hair, unusual for Dregans, shone as though made of burnished gold and had attracted many admiring comments, much to the shy male's embarrassment. But he had smiled and accepted the compliments and had felt Xavier's pride at the way he handled himself as much as from the admiration.</p><p>Xavier's outfit was simple white pants with a gold waistcoat which did nothing to hide the bulk and innate power of the large reptilian. Now he had been caught in conversation by some Terra II medics and Theophilus had wandered away a little, caught up in the magic of the evening. He had even spoken to a couple of dark-haired denizens of Drega. He was aware there was some disagreement within the Dregan delegation, but didn't understand the mechanics of it. Whilst he may have been born on Drega, Earth, Phixia and PrideHome were his home worlds now. He ambled towards the open French windows and stared out into the manicured gardens. White and yellow lights twinkled giving it an ethereal appearance and Theophilus took another step, entranced by the beauty.</p><p>Two large males moved silently behind him, scooping him under his arms to bundle him forwards. Theophilus was peripherally aware they were Dregan, but the speed and shock of the attack caught him so much by surprise, he didn't have time to cry out. He was pinned to an outside wall and as he recovered his stunned wits, he recognised the hard, scarred visage before him.</p><p>"Father," he whispered.</p><p>"Hardly the way to greet me after so many years apart, Theophilus," the silver-haired male smiled malevolently. "I think this more appropriate."</p><p>He covered the blond's lips with his own, thrusting a tongue past Theophilus' teeth as his knee pushed between the younger male's slender thighs. Marcellous kept Theophilus' hands pinned above his head as he plundered the unwilling mouth, knowing that the blond's upbringing would make it impossible for him to try and physically resist the man who was his father. In the past, all children on Drega had been trained from infancy to obey their sires unquestioningly. The society had been a brutal, unbending patriarchal system. More recently this practice had been outlawed, but in Marcellous' time, he had brought up all his sons in this manner; especially his youngest child for whom he'd had such special plans.</p><p>For a second or two, Theophilus' childhood training made him pliant in his father's hold, then, to Marcellous' surprise, he began to fight to free himself. The kiss was broken as silver and gold struggled, then Theophilus felt himself pushed backwards as he managed to pull free and another male stood between him and his father.</p><p>"Get your filthy hands off my son, you bastard" Jameson growled menacingly. He was vibrating with barely controlled fury. He'd seen Theophilus apparently ushered outside and something had niggled about the action. Now he gave silent thanks for his impeccable instincts.</p><p>"*Your* son?" Marcellous spat incredulously. "A mere *human*? He. Is. *Mine*."</p><p>Marcellous spoke each word with such venom it had Theophilus terrified. He reached to Jameson, trying either to pull him away from the advancing Dregan or to interpose his own body between them. His golden eyes locked with the cold silver orbs of the vastly older male as Marcellous advanced towards them.</p><p>"You turned your back on him, renouncing him as your son when he chose to marry Xavier. I welcomed him freely into my home and am proud to call him my son," Jameson continued, resisting Theophilus' persistent tugging. The mature human had no intention of letting the depraved bastard before him touch his beloved blond again.</p><p>"You are part of a human family?" Marcellous sneered.</p><p>"Jameson has been more of a father to me in the years I have known him that you were in all the years that preceded. I love him and I am proud to call him Papa." Theophilus said sincerely. He was hoping to divert attention from Jameson to himself and found his strategy working too well. Chilling silver eyes sent shivers down his spine.</p><p>"Then perhaps I should remind you just who your real father is, boy," Marcellous snarled. The big Dregan's power and speed took even Theophilus by surprise as the blond had never challenged one of his own kind before. Jameson was effortlessly pushed aside with one hand as the other brutally backhanded the smaller Dregan, sending him spinning to the ground, too stunned to be able to protect himself as Marcellous continued to stalk forward. Theophilus looked up dazed only to see his father jerked backwards to be slammed against the same wall he had been pinned against.</p><p>"Touch any of my family again and I will kill you." Xavier stood, his frill a shade of red that Theophilus had never seen before, tail lashing furiously from side-to-side and his normally placid expression changed out of all recognition. The reptilian's whole demeanour was one of unadulterated rage.</p><p>Jameson had already regained his feet and glanced with concern at the blond whose body was beginning to shake from the shock of all that had happened. He wanted Theophilus away from here.</p><p>"Marcellous is not a recognised name on the delegate list, Xavier," he said, glaring at the male who now stood with the other Dregan. "I will ensure he is deported immediately from Terra II." He lowered his voice. "Your husband needs you," he added.</p><p>Xavier's attention swiftly moved to his lover who was still on the ground. With a muted sound of grief, Xavier reached to scoop Theophilus into his arms. He crooned softly as his mate buried his head into a powerful shoulder.</p><p>"Take me away from here, husband," he pleaded, his voice a bare whisper. "Please take me away."</p><p>Xavier threw a desperate look at Jameson who nodded curtly.</p><p>"Take him where he feels safe, Xavier. I'll deal with this and call to see you're both alright later."</p><p>Xavier strode to their room, ignoring looks and whispers as they passed. He regretted they had to move through the ballroom. A couple of the Dregans his beloved had spoken to looked shocked, but Xavier was uncaring of others, just the precious bundle in his arms. He was grateful to see security guards heading towards Jameson and presumed the more mature human male had used a personal security device to alert them to his need. Xavier locked their door and curled protectively around his lover in their nest until the silent tears were spent. Golden eyes, heavy with soul-deep sadness, gazed anxiously into his own orbs.</p><p>"Do you still love me?" Theophilus asked tremulously.</p><p>"Of course I do, my beloved," Xavier vowed.</p><p>"He kissed me, touched me," Theophilus whispered. "My body is now only to be so touched by the man I love. I failed to stop him..."</p><p>"Shh, my love," Xavier crooned, not wanting his husband to blame himself for the unprovoked attack by Marcellous. "He tried to take that which belongs only to me. *He* failed. For which I am forever grateful. You are my husband, my beloved mate. No matter what might have happened, I would still love you. I will always love you. Let me show you."</p><p>Theophilus was unresisting as Xavier tenderly stripped his still shivering form. He allowed his husband to lay him flat, the bigger male looming dominantly over him. A forked tongue began to lick at him along his throat as a sinuous tail stroked the satin skin of his inner thighs. Without conscious thought, he spread himself open, lying submissively, vulnerably, before the man he adored. Large, strong hands caressed his chest, tugging at his small pink nipples and fondling his lax rod and hairless sac. The combination of different touches over so much of his body soon had the younger male lost in a maelstrom of sensation. Slowly his shaft rose, his channel began to produce its lubricant, dilating slowly, ready for penetration and he moaned mindlessly as Xavier's tail slid inside to caress his hidden sweetness. He cried wordlessly as a single hemipenis replaced Xavier's tail inside his body. Instead the agile appendage spiralled around his throbbing erection to begin rhythmic contractions. He felt his lover's knot stretch his sheath and then hot juices were filling him, triggering his own release.</p><p>"I love you," he heard Xavier vow. "I will always love you."</p><p>"Never let me go," he pleaded. "I love you so much."</p><p>"Never," Xavier promised. "No one will ever take you away from me. Rest, my precious, sleep safe in my arms. Our family will arrive tomorrow and we all love you."</p><p>As Theophilus lay sleeping fitfully, Xavier hugged him tightly. He only released the traumatised blond long enough to reassure an anxious Jameson that Theophilus was not unduly harmed physically. As yet, he was unsure of the mental damage the assault may have caused. He cradled the younger man long into the night, crooning and stroking when Theophilus seemed to be becoming more restless. If he had thought he had hated Marcellous before, it was nothing compared to the loathing that now coursed through reptilian veins.</p><p>****</p><p>Tristam, Rayner, Uist and Sholto listened to Jameson with a mixture of shock, horror and fury as he recounted what had befallen their much-loved brothers. Jameson had both entered a formal charge against Marcellous and pointed out he had no right to be on the planet in the first place. The Terra II liaison officer assigned to him, one to whom Jameson had taken an instant dislike, had responded and had Marcellous put under house arrest until a ship could be readied to deport him.</p><p>"Marcellous' life is forfeit should he and I cross paths," Uist growled, his claws unsheathing and re-sheathing. "I intend to request recognition of PrideHome blood feud."</p><p>"Uist, wait," Jameson said, holding up a restraining hand. "As much as I detest Marcellous, I would not want to do anything to further distress Theophilus. Be very certain of what he wants and what he needs. Marcellous is still his father and at present Theophilus is afraid, shocked and worried about how you will react to him. To him, not Marcellous," he emphasised.</p><p>"But why?" Rayner asked. "He did nothing wrong."</p><p>"Theophilus was raised knowing he was a commodity to be sold and to obey his father unquestioningly. It took many years for Xavier to make him understand theirs was a partnership of equals. As much as he adores his husband, and they were clearly made for each other, it can still be hard for him to ask for what he wants and needs. He blames himself for the assault, for not reacting quicker or more strongly, and preventing what transpired. His initial fear was losing Xavier's love, his second losing ours. Although he will be unable to ask for it, what he needs now is for us to show him just how much we love him."</p><p>"I will be guided by you this time, Papa," Uist conceded reluctantly. He pulled Sholto close to his side. The possessive gesture spoke eloquently of the cat-man's inner turmoil. "But if Marcellous ever tries again to harm any of my family, as you are my witnesses, I will evoke blood feud. He will find no safe refuge in this universe from me or mine."</p><p>****</p><p>It was an unnaturally quiet and subdued group that headed to the quarters assigned to Xavier and Theophilus. Normally there would be teasing banter and laughter. Five hearts clenched as they caught their first sight of their blond brother. The normally confident male was huddled close to his mate, his face expressing fear, doubt, misery and worry. For Rayner it was too much to bear. With a muted cry he ran from the rest of the group, aware that Sholto was just a step behind. Both wrapped their arms around Theophilus almost simultaneously.</p><p>"We love you, Theophilus," Rayner assured, knowing he spoke for all. He kissed a cool, too-pale cheek.</p><p>"All of us," Sholto added, kissing the other. Both were relieved when Theophilus' arms reached to encircle them and hold them tightly.</p><p>"I love you all so much," Theophilus said, his voice thick with emotion. "I feared I had forfeited your love for me."</p><p>"Never," both Rayner and Sholto spoke. "No matter what happens, Theophilus, remember we will always love you." The two humans stepped back as the rest of the group now moved to join them and Uist came forward. They watched as Theophilus' head dropped submissively, unwilling to meet the intense blue gaze of the PrideHomer.</p><p>Gently, but persistently, Uist used a single finger to tip Theophilus' chin upwards until their eyes could meet.</p><p>"I love you, beautiful," he said softly. He wrapped his arms around the lithe form as Theophilus almost collapsed against him. He kissed the smooth forehead and nuzzled him affectionately. He could still scent fear and anxiety, but it was receding. Slowly.</p><p>"I love you, my Protector," Theophilus whispered, using Uist's title.</p><p>Giving one last squeeze, Uist released Theophilus for Tristam to come forward; the leader of their team, husband of Rayner, chosen brother of all and Protector of Theophilus and Sholto.</p><p>"Theophilus," he said softly. "No matter where you are, or whatever may befall you, remember you are family. We will stand by you, for you, search endlessly if you are lost to us and love you unconditionally." He accepted the armfuls of sobbing blond as the last of Theophilus' fears gave way to cleansing tears. One by one, the rest of the group moved to join the embracing couple.</p><p>Like a silent sentinel above them, the complex security camera caught and recorded everything said and done until they finally broke apart. A residual sadness still remained, but it was clear from the brighter, less haunted look in Theophilus' eyes that his family had found exactly the right things to say to reassure him.</p><p>****</p><p>That day and the next passed without incident. Theophilus was becoming more his normal self, laughing and playing with his family. The only outward sign of any insecurity was the need for more contact from his mate. The reptilian was more than happy to provide kisses and caresses as necessary, pleased to see his lover less inhibited. The group were happy to find that Jameson was free to join them for an evening meal although they could see the older human was frustrated by the lack of progress.</p><p>"I begin to wonder why Drega elected Telleran to be lead delegate with power of veto. It seems his notion about how the treaty should be worded is out of step with both the rest of his own people and Terra II. It's not only frustrating everyone, but he's making enemies of all by his attitude. He's conceding things slowly, but at this rate it's going to take a week or more to conclude what should be arranged in just a couple of days."</p><p>"Telleran's family are one of the largest on Drega," Theophilus supplied. "They are quite powerful and influential."</p><p>"Perhaps he's just like many of the old-school, patriarchal Dregans who think they should simply speak and be obeyed?" Sholto offered.<br/></p>They ate their meal, the conversation moving away from the annoying day Jameson had endured. It was with a scowl that, as he finished his coffee, the older man took a message from the room phone and stood."I need to go and speak with Terra II liaison Marlok," he explained. "I'll be back as quickly as possible."Jameson growled at the "Out of order' sign on the nearby elevator and headed to the stairs. He stepped out onto the landing and began to descend cautiously. The lights were out and it was almost pitch black. He successfully navigated the first set and began the second. As he did, a hard shove in the centre of his back sent him tumbling the rest of the way down to lie unmoving.Simultaneously, back in their room, Rayner gave a sharp cry."Papa." His eyes were unfocused and as he slowly recovered, Theophilus hovering at his side, the rest of the group followed Tristam.At the doorway, he extended his hearing. Locating Jameson's heartbeat, he ran unerringly. Uist was at his side, nostrils flaring, locating the human male by scent. It took just seconds for Jameson to be found. Xavier's superficial medical check assuring them he was not badly hurt. They quickly transported him into the on-site medical facility.Jameson lay scowling in the pristine bed, a bandage adorning his brow. He had bruised ribs, a mild concussion and was not being allowed out of bed for 24 hours. He glared balefully at Tristam as if it was the blond's fault and got a sympathetic smile in return."At least it's nothing serious," Tristam said. He shared Jameson's dislike of hospitals and could empathise with not wanting to remain in one a moment longer than necessary. "Rest as they want and you'll soon be out of here."The group looked up as Marlok bustled in, his face a mask of confusion."I got your message," he told Tristam. "But I sent no message myself to meet with Jameson.""I'm taking charge of this investigation," Tristam growled."Investigation?" Marlok's face blanched. "What investigation? Under what authority?""A deliberate attack on the negotiation's facilitator, an attack on an earth national, an attack on Elite personnel. Any and all of those give me the authority I need." Tristam stalked forward menacingly as he reeled off the reasons and Marlok back-pedalled rapidly. "Take your pick. I want the security tapes of the stairwell for the half hour preceding the incident as well of those that cover his movements from the room to the stairs.""Theophilus and I will stay here tonight," Xavier said. He, Uist and Tristam glanced to where their mates now fussed over the older human, a smile of affection on his lips."Good idea," Uist growled and Tristam nodded. They did not want to leave their Papa unprotected until they knew exactly what was going on.****Tristam insisted on personally checking the security tapes and encouraged Uist and Sholto to retire for the night with the promise that if he saw anything to help, he would call them immediately.Once in their room, Uist wasted no time in stripping himself and his mate and positioning Sholto on the bed on all-fours. Fingers drenched in oil then slid inside him, opening him for his dominant mate and the cat-man quickly pressed his impressive sex inside his lover. Sholto dropped his head down to the mattress, arms crossed under his forehead, backside high and vulnerable. The position did marvellous things to him, putting pressure in different places so that Uist's shaft felt thicker and longer, He clenched his internal muscles, rotating his hips and Uist murmured and groaned his approval. Sholto muttered a protest when his mate pulled out of his body, but it died in his throat as his cheeks were spread wide and Uist's tongue invaded his most intimate passage. The large, agile organ thrust and teased, tasted and tormented until the smaller man was incoherent with need."You, you, you," he chanted, unable to voice anything more complex.Uist purred with approval. Repositioning himself, he slid his erection back inside slick heat, the slender channel rippling erotically around his length. He slipped his arms around Sholto's chest, pulling the smaller body astride his powerful thighs. In this new position, Uist knew his mate was even more vulnerable, relying on him to pleasure his body. As such, one of his hands toyed with diamond-hard, cinnamon nubs whilst the other stroked hard, damp flesh jutting proudly from a lush pelt of pubic fur. Uist nipped and sucked at Sholto's neck, wanting to mark his mate. His haunches drove upwards, burying him deep in the tight, searing sheath."Close...close," Sholto moaned. Pleasure that had begun deep in his belly, now radiated outwards. Sholto was keening, his body stiffening and then trembling. Uist felt him come, felt the way he stilled and then jerked, his back arched and head thrown back every muscle convulsing in joy and relief. Though centred in his groin, his orgasm ripped pleasure through him, sweeping him up in ecstasy. As his velvet sheath contracted around the solid flesh impaling him, he heard Uist's roar and then his hot, wet essence was filling his shaking body. He murmured wordlessly as their still-joined bodies were lowered to the bed and Uist spooned lovingly behind him."I love you," he whispered and then yawned, drained from the intense lovemaking."Love you, mine," Uist rumbled. As his lover slept, Uist remained awake, guarding his precious bundle. Already two he loved had been hurt and he had no intention of failing his own mate.****Tristam rubbed irritably at eyes that ached from trying to enhance a blurred image on the grainy film. The image of Jameson's cowardly attacker. He felt a headache begin at the base of his skull and blinked as the machine he hunched over was switched off. He allowed his insistent mate to lead him to their bed. Rayner stripped them both and the tendrils of their psychic link began to banish his headache as his lover positioned himself between wide-spread thighs. A soft, moist tongue bathed his sac and then kisses were peppered over his furred groin. Slowly, Rayner's mouth meandered to the long, thick, reddened flesh that rose to weep silvery tears of desire. The tears were licked appreciatively away before the engorged head was slowly and deliberately sucked. A slender hand pumped at the base and Tristam relaxed into the physical and mental pleasure that he could only experience with his young husband. Rayner hummed happily as Tristam's hips began to undulate slowly and shallowly. He rolled the furred sac, caressing the precious orbs within, silently encouraging Tristam to let go. He relished Tristam's groan as he swallowed thick flesh to the root, inhaling musk and desire. Then his lover's orgasm washed over him. Pulses after pulse of salty sweet crème filled Rayner's mouth to be swallowed greedily. As the last drops trickled down Rayner's throat, Tristam's body finally lay sated and spent. Rayner draped himself over the bigger body and the lovers kissed gently, love superseding lust."Straddle me, kneel astride my head," Tristam's voice was thick with desire. He heard the almost sub vocal whimpers as Rayner carefully positioned himself as instructed. His lover's slender rod bobbed daintily before his avaricious eyes and then he sucked it in deep. He gripped Rayner's buttocks, encouraging the smaller man to commence a slow rocking motion that drove the shaft on which he fed gently in and out of his mouth. He gave a moan of enjoyment that clearly vibrated through Rayner's sex and the younger man gasped pleasurably. Occasionally hollowing his cheeks to increase suction, Tristam reached out to mentally caress his special mate. The low moan heralded his success. He reached to pull the creamy buttocks apart and caress the tight opening and his reward was Rayner's nectar filling his ravenous maw. Tristam milked his mate dry before finally they lay sated in each other's arms."You need to rest, love." Rayner said solicitously, feeling his mate's mind beginning to work once again on the attack."I need digital enhancing equipment," Tristam replied, his mind now made up. He began to relax, letting Rayner's warmth and satiated scent wash over him."We can't bring advanced technology from 'Silver.'" Rayner's voice seemed to come from a long way off, but Tristam insisted on answering."I'm contacting another Elite. It will form part of our investigative equipment."He felt Rayner nestle close and ensured his young husband was encircled in his arms. Something about the shadowy figure niggled at him. He was certain the danger was not yet passed. Slowly, he let himself drift into sleep.In the medical facility, Xavier cradled a sleeping Theophilus on his lap. He held tightly with loving arms and had wrapped his tail around the slender waist. His young husband had finally fallen into an exhausted sleep draped over the bedside of the human he loved as a father. Xavier had carefully positioned his lover in his lap to make his sleep as comfortable as possible. He had not wanted to leave him in one of the small, hard plastic chairs. They were exceptionally uncomfortable, especially to one of Xavier's size and bulk. He glanced over at Jameson who was resting peacefully. He gave a mental sigh of relief that the mature human's injuries had proven so minor. He knew how devastated all of his diverse family would have been at his loss, but especially his mate who slumbered unaware in his arms. The human meant so much to the whole group. The reptilian muted a sigh as Theophilus murmured softly. He wished his love's sleep was more restful, and free of the bad dreams deemed too numerous for the reptilian's liking. Moreover, he prayed his feelings that this was far from over would prove to be wrong.****Jameson awoke to meet Xavier's watchful eyes. He wondered if the big male had stayed awake all night. He felt sore, but not uncomfortably so given his fall. He gave an affectionate smile at the sight of the slumbering blond in Xavier's arms."I'm going to petition to get out of here," he told the reptilian. "Why not take sleeping beauty to your room? I'll call in there as soon as I'm released.""Do you want me to alert the others?" Xavier asked as he rose, careful not to unduly jostle his mate."I'll do it myself," Jameson said with a wry smile. "I'll doubtless need to prove I'm competent and capable to be let out."Xavier opened the door to their room and his eyes took in the note on the floor. He laid Theophilus in their nest and retrieved the paper. He gave a mental frown as he read it.'Tell the Dregan child to remain in the room. Meet me in the crypt. Alone. I know what happened to the human.'Xavier glanced at the clock and at the time on the note. It gave him only 10 minutes. He then noticed the gold eyes staring at the paper."I have to go," he said softly. He passed the missive to Theophilus. He was surprised at the speed by which Theophilus reached the door before him."I am *not* a child and will not be confined to our room like one. I will *not* allow you to go alone. Do not make me have to stop you," he pleaded.Xavier looked at the lithe, trembling form. He had no doubt that his distraught lover would indeed try and stop him if he proceeded. Yet they had to follow up this lead."I do not want you hurt," Xavier confessed."If the writer of this note does not appear, I have no doubts in the ability of our group to find them and our Papa's assailant. Take me with you; I would not see you hurt either."Reluctantly, Xavier nodded. He left the note where it could be found by any of their family looking for them. He slipped his arms around Theophilus' waist and the blond immediately tilted his head back. Xavier's tongue flicked in and out of his lover's mouth, tasting the warm, silken inner walls. He felt his mate melt against him."We must proceed with caution," Xavier admonished as they separated from their kiss.He'd made a study of the complex and the crypt was actually old catacombs that historians had insisted be preserved when the new building was erected. There was a set of stairs and one single lift, distinct from the others servicing the complex, as the historians tried to preserve the catacombs as they were. Reaching the basement, the couple checked the stairs first. A warning sign was erected as they reached the final sets of steps. Xavier went a little way down to verify and could see that several, extending below his ability to see clearly, were damaged and dangerous. He returned to his mate and they moved to the elevator. Both males reacted to the acrid, cleaning smell. The machinery creaked ominously; it was clearly much older than the elevators in the complex, which were probably renewed regularly. As it descended, Xavier was certain he could taste/scent something familiar underneath the sour, sharp cleanser.As the doors opened, both men flattened themselves against the walls until assured there was no unexpected less-than-welcoming party awaiting them. They moved away from the elevator. Stone corridors and archways led off in several directions. They glanced around uncertainly. Now they were outside, Theophilus, too, began to scent something familiar. He tilted his head, trying to focus his antennae to filter out the single scent he wished to identify. They hadn't moved too far away from the elevator when Theophilus turned with wide eyes to his lover."Xavier, the scent..."The reptilian was already barrelling towards his mate."Down, down," he roared. He wrapped his body around that of the blond mammal and they were still airborne as the explosive he'd recognised detonated. They were flung deeper into the catacombs by its force. The elevator was destroyed and their bodies were showered with a mixture of metal and rock as they lay unmoving. In the eerie silence that followed, all that could be seen of the two males was blood and dust-streaked blond hair underneath a pile of fallen stone.****Jameson was already with the rest of his family as the explosion sounded. He glanced anxiously as Tristam tried unsuccessfully to raise Theophilus or Xavier on his wrist communicator."Rayner, Sholto, try their room," he commanded. "We'll follow up on the explosion."The group separated. Hotel management and security hovered around the damaged elevator as if uncertain of what to do.Uist growled and unsheathed his claws. Digging them into the closed doors, he used his strength to prise them apart. Heat and smoke began to escape, but the cat-man continued. Finally they were fully open. There was too much smoke for him to scent anything but explosive, burning and dust. He watched as Tristam tried to peer down the shaft."Where does this go?" he asked, unable to penetrate the smoke."This shaft leads to the catacombs," the manager replied."Stairs?" Tristam asked."Reported damaged yesterday. We put up a sign. Nobody goes from the hotel to the catacombs. We thought to repair them once the conference was over.""You didn't think to alert anyone over the damage?" Uist rumbled ominously."What was to report?" the manager replied desperately. "What impact could it have on the rest of the hotel?"Uist impatiently indicated the smoke still floating from the shaft."I think you know now," he said with a wave of his hand."Xavier and Theophilus went somewhere called the catacombs," Rayner's voice cut in as he and Sholto returned. The brunette held the note, passing it to Jameson. He glanced fearfully at the elevator. "No," he whispered."We need to get down there," Tristam said. "There has to be a way.""Air vents," came a confident voice. All eyes turned to look at the most senior hotel man standing there. "The air vents reach down to the catacombs."Tristam's eyes focused on the mesh at the far end of the corridor."I need this area to be sealed off. No one but my group and Jameson is to have access," Tristam instructed the overall manager. "Have your security stationed to prevent anyone moving in or out. Uist and I will descend, Rayner, you stay here and make sure my orders are carried out. Sholto, I need some rope and a medical kit. If our family are down there, they may be unable to walk out." Tristam's level of concern was illustrated by the curt commands he issued. If they were to help their brothers, speed and efficiency were necessities.As people moved to obey him, Tristam pulled the cover from the vent, tossing it casually aside. The tunnel was easily large enough for the two males. Uist descended first, his strong claws of hands and feet penetrating the metal allowing him to climb down effortlessly. By the time he had reached the bottom, Tristam was slithering quickly down one rope, another around his waist, a small medical bag in one hand. The men stopped, both heads tilted, both listening desperately. As one they moved towards the remnants of the elevator. Tristam's groan echoed the sound of grief from the PrideHomer as Theophilus' hair came into view. Quickly and carefully they began to move the debris that covered at least one of their brothers. At Uist's pained growl, Tristam caught sight of pale green skin."Xavier's on top of him," Tristam observed aloud. Their efforts increased. Soon they had their family from beneath the rubble. Xavier was clearly the most badly hurt. A wound to his hip and thigh was still oozing blood, he was covered in multiple scrapes and cuts, his frill was torn and bloodied and a gash covered almost from one aural depression to the other across the base of his skull. As they settled their injured brother, Theophilus began to stir. Tristam, focused on Xavier, let Uist tend the blond."Xavier?" Theophilus moaned softly."He is hurt, but Tristam is attending him." Uist spoke softly as he looked into dazed gold eyes. Theophilus seemed to be concussed slightly and had superficial cuts, but had obviously been shielded by Xavier from the main blast."I have to see him. I have to help." Theophilus struggled against Uist's restraining hands, desperate to reach his husband."Please, Theophilus. Stay still," Uist urged. "Your mate will be fine; Tristam will take care of him.""Have to help," Theophilus murmured, as though unable to hear Uist's words, his efforts to move becoming more insistent.It occurred to Uist that the blond's hearing may have been affected by the sound and he locked his eyes with the slighter form."Stay still." He mouthed the words rather than speaking them and Theophilus gazed sadly at him."Please, I have to see, have to help." Theophilus continued to attempt to move, to reach the man he loved.Uist was afraid the blond was becoming too agitated. Desperation was replacing the dazed expression and, whilst he understood and empathised with Theophilus, he knew he couldn't allow him to be trying to stand or help."I'm sorry, beautiful," he said sincerely, unsure he was heard. He slipped his hand under Theophilus' chin, his thumb parallel to the pointed ear's small lobe. Regret flooded his eyes as realisation of his action was reflected in Theophilus' and they widened fearfully. As a slender hand reached weakly to pull his away, Uist pressed hard. For a second the lithe body stiffened and then, eyes rolling back, went fully limp. "So sorry, beautiful," Uist repeated, kissing the now unconscious male."You had no choice, Uist," Tristam said sympathetically, glancing up from where he worked on tending to the more grievously wounded reptilian. "I have a small nanobot injection I can give him. I'll ensure the Elite I've called in bring another. I'm not jeopardising his recovery by relying on a planet with comparatively primitive medical facilities and no experience in healing off-world denizens, especially one so exotic as Xavier."<br/>"I can transform and if Xavier is roped to me, I will have no difficulty ascending to safety taking him with me." Uist gazed sadly at the unconscious blond. "I pray he forgives me.""He will," Tristam said confidently. "He was hurt, frightened and confused. When he recovers he will understand." Tristam gripped tightly to the cat-man's arm. "He will forgive you using his own body against him, it was for his, and his mate's, good."****Soon both injured males were in beds in the medical facility. Tristam insisted they were in a private room; partly because he knew that Theophilus would want privacy to be close to his mate and partly so they could be more easily protected. Jameson and Uist sat at the blond's bedside, Sholto and Rayner at Xavier's. The reptilian was still and silent. At his side, a saline solution was slowly dripped into his arm, the only medical treatment Tristam had permitted other than cleaning and dressing the lizard's injuries. Tristam had slipped away and been in contact with the Team Leader of the Elite responding to his earlier call and now he awaited their imminent arrival. He returned to the facility to ensure his family were comfortable. A doctor came into the room and Tristam's warning growl was echoed by Uist's."I just want to examine them," the medic explained. "I'm Senior Medic Jaysen.""Are you versed in the physiology of Phixians or Dregans?" Tristam queried."No," came the honest reply. "But I am a doctor and I want to care for my patients. I'm willing to be an observer. I wouldn't presume to gainsay anything you deem required for their wellbeing." Jaysen wondered at the tilt to the blond's head. He felt he was being scrutinised more deeply than he could account for in the unwavering gaze. However, the big male must have found whatever he sought as he gave a curt nod."Either Uist or I will oversee any treatments by right of Commander and Deputy for Xavier and by right as Protector to his mate. However, I am prepared for you, and only you, to be involved in their care.""That's fine by me," the doctor replied. There was no way Jaysen intended to try and challenge him.It was moments after the doctor had left that Theophilus began to stir. When Jameson leant forward, Uist vacated his position, retreating to stand close to the door."Papa?" the blond asked shakily."Yes, son," Jameson smiled. "I'm here.""Xavier?" Theophilus asked, his usually melodic voice tight with fear. The normal bond, a couple long-mated enjoyed, was not functioning. He was too scared to consider that his own concussive injury would be playing a large part in the problem."Hurt, but not as badly as we initially feared. He's resting comfortably. He bore the brunt of the blast.""He protected me," Theophilus said in a tiny voice. "Please do not let him die.""He'll be fine in a few days," Tristam said confidently, coming to stand at Jameson's side. "I promise."Anxious gold met certain cerulean and took comfort in the assured gaze; a hesitant smile Tristam's reward. Theophilus eyes took in his human brothers at his mate's side and then the lone figure of his Protector who remained distant. A tiny frown marred the smooth brow and then his fingers traced where Uist had taken advantage of his intimate knowledge of Dregan pressure points. He remembered how dazed and disorientated he had been, how his ears had rung and buzzed. He knew he had been approaching hysteria and understood why Uist had acted. He could have endangered them all and especially his hurt lover. He reached out to Uist."Please," he whispered, uncertain whether Uist was angry at his behaviour. "I am sorry.""No, beautiful," Uist said, closing the distance in the blink of an eye to hold tight to the slender hand. "I'm sorry. You were hurt and confused, I acted as I thought best to protect you.""And I am grateful to you. You are not angered?" Theophilus added. He felt uncertain of everything. In the time he had spent with his mate, Xavier had always been his rock, his anchor and without the big male to reassure him, all the blond's fears and anxieties threatened to overwhelm him."My fear was you would be angry with me," Uist said with a smile."I am so very scared," Theophilus murmured softly.Uist sat on the bed and pulled the slender form into his arms. Uist's soft sound of contentment was echoed by the wordless hum from his beloved brother, each man receiving and offering succour to the other. Uist drank in the sweet scent from the willowy blond. There was still the sour taint of fear and worry, but they were lessening."Your mate is strong and will recover soon," Uist said, his words a resonance of those spoken by Tristam."Until you are well enough to be able to defend yourself and your husband, at least one of us will remain with you at all times," Tristam said decisively. "It's getting late. I could take first watch...""No," Uist said quickly, standing to face Tristam, throwing a pleading look at his commander. "I will guard them.""Me too," Sholto added. He took his husband's place, giving a hug and kiss to the blond before settling with an obstinate look at his mate. He smiled when he got a resigned nod from the cat-man. He wasn't prepared to leave Uist to mount vigil and guard duty unaccompanied.Jameson, followed by Rayner and finally Tristam came to give Theophilus a reassuring hug before leaving them in Uist's care and the blond was grateful for the physical contact. He threw a worried glance over at his mate and then turned soulful eyes at Uist."Uist, may my bed be closer to my husband?" he asked hopefully. "I would like to be able to hold his hand.""Of course, beautiful," Uist rumbled. The distance between beds was easily closed and Theophilus gave a sigh of satisfaction as he clasped tightly to Xavier's large hand. He smiled at Sholto as the smaller human fussed at the pillows and bedding of both males."Lie back and sleep awhile," Sholto ordered of the slender man. "You need your rest just as much as your husband. We'll be here if you need us.""Thank you, my brother," Theophilus smiled. He gave a pleasured sound as Sholto began a slow stroking of his hair. The auburn-haired young human giving a grin to his lover as Theophilus quickly resumed a healing slumber. Sholto's grin widened at the smile and incline of Uist's head at his success. Sholto took his position at the head of Theophilus' bed, accepting his mate's desire to be closer to the door. Uist was more likely to recognise a threat approaching. He settled himself in the uncomfortable chair.****Jameson, Rayner and Tristam were called before liaison Marlok. The grey haired man was agitated and far from happy with the proceedings to date. To Jameson's frustration and Tristam's rapidly unravelling restraint, Marlok went so far as to suggest Tristam was purposely failing to keep him updated on what was happening. His main concern was that the incidents may interfere with the ongoing negotiations. Already the Dregans refused entry to their rooms to any except a fellow Dregan or Marlok, citing a not unreasonable fear, as far as Marlok was concerned, that they may be in danger themselves. His questioning was insidious, making the three men feel as though they were in some way on trial or even responsible for the events to date. Tristam agreed, through clenched teeth, to ensure Marlok was updated on progress every four hours. Only then did the other man deign to leave.A tap to the door had Tristam on his feet growling menacingly. It was with relief all round that the door was opened to reveal the Elite Tristam had called for assistance. The blond hugged and back-slapped the ebony skinned man who entered first. Darius was a respected leader and had proven skills that Tristam was relieved would be at their disposal. The other three members of his team were also known and valued men and Tristam finally began to feel that the tide had turned in their favour. Between the two Elite teams, he was certain they would discover and identify the unknown attacker. Darius had the imaging equipment and was happy to set it up and begin work on enhancing the tapes Tristam had. He also passed over another dose of nanobots. Tristam clasped his shoulder gratefully."It's good to see you, my friend," the blond said sincerely. "Although I wish the circumstances were better."****It was some considerable time later that Tristam and Rayner returned to their room. As soon as the door was shut, the bigger man enveloped the brunette in a tight hug."Need you, angel," Tristam groaned as he inhaled the scent of his lover. "Let me love you.""Always," Rayner replied.Clothes quickly vanished as mutual arousal grew. Kisses became heated, deeper, wetter and tongues slid sinuously in one man's mouth then the other. Tristam bent his head to feed ravenously at expresso areolae, teasing with fingers whichever tiny nub was bereft of his mouth. A hand slid down Rayner's smooth caramel skin to probe carefully at the tiny, furled rosette hidden in his lover's downy declivity. He entered Rayner's body with a single finger, his lover's moan music to his ears. He pressed in a second then a third, sliding his fingers across Rayner's sweet spot until his dark beauty could no longer bear it."You, please, I need you," he begged the bigger man.At the end of his own control, Tristam oiled his aching shaft and buried himself in welcoming, searing tightness. Both men groaned as Rayner's sheath rippled and contracted around the conquering flesh. Tristam moved slowly, but he needed the joining too urgently to keep lovemaking slow and sweet. He lifted Rayner's calves to his shoulders allowing him to reach deeper into the beloved body. He began a deep, rhythmic pounding into his mate, almost folding the lithe body in half as he desperately sought to mate their mouths. His hands burrowed between their sweat-dampened bodies to stroke his lover's yearning arousal. The soft cry of his name and the wet heat pulsing over his hand were enough to trigger his own release. He heard Rayner's guttural groan as the lithe body was filled with his hot, wet juices. His hips pumped repeatedly, determined that every drop of his essence would be buried deep in his young love. Finally his thrusting stilled and soft, tender kisses were traded in the afterglow."Thank you, angel," Tristam whispered against warm, smooth skin."I love you," Rayner smiled, his tone reflecting his satiation. He gave a wordless cry as warm wetness bathed his heated skin and Tristam's tongue swept over his body to cleanse him of his release. As Tristam's head moved back and forth, Rayner caressed the shaggy mane of blond hair and powerful shoulders. He wriggled in Tristam's possessive embrace as the bigger man finally spooned up behind him."I love you, baby," Tristam whispered, as he felt Rayner relax into sleep. "So much."****Uist gave a soft growl of discontent as he regarded his sleeping young husband. The small plastic chairs were no place for his lover to be trying to rest. As tempting as it was to sit the small body in his lap, Uist needed to be able to protect at a second's notice. He saw tired golden orbs blink sleepily at him."Sorry, Theophilus," he whispered. "I just need to find a way to make Sholto more comfortable." He gave an apologetic smile as Theophilus' drowsy gaze moved to the somnolent human.With a small shuffle, Theophilus moved closer to the edge of his bed nearest his beloved husband. He gave a sad smile at the still sleeping reptilian, but took comfort from the fact that Uist was apparently unconcerned and his mate seemed to be resting comfortably. Normal colour was returning slowly to both Xavier's skin and healing frill. Turning his gaze back to his Protector he raised his right arm in invitation.Uist felt hotness prickle at his eyes. Even now the blond sought to give comfort to others. Grateful for the unconditional love of the Dregan youth, Uist carefully lifted Sholto to lay him at Theophilus' side. As a slender arm encircled the smaller body, Uist gave a smile of satisfaction as his mate rolled onto his side and burrowed against the lithe, sweet-scented body."Thank you, beautiful," Uist whispered almost silently, as he watched the gold eyes slide shut once again. Adjusting his chair, Uist prepared to be a silent sentinel watching over his sleeping family.****Doctor Jaysen entered the room housing the injured aliens and stopped, frowning. He took in the beds moved closer and the auburn and blond heads visible sharing one of them. He then became aware of the ominous growling. His eyes moved to the hitherto unnoticed watcher."I...I meant no disrespect," he offered shakily. "It's just... just not what I expected." The cat-man's eyes seemed to have an amber glow and the doctor backed away hastily. "If there's nothing I can do now, I'll come back later."Uist watched him leave dispassionately. He owed neither explanation nor justification to the other man. He' simply taken care of those he loved as they needed."Uist?" a soft voice whispered."It's alright, beautiful. The complex's medical staff will come back later," Uist said to the waking blond.Theophilus moved to be able to turn and look at his mate."You ok, Theophilus," Sholto asked, his voice sleepy."I am so much, much more, my brother," came the reply.The joyful tone had both Uist and Sholto moving to gaze over a pale, slender shoulder. Sholto's whoop of glee was complimented by a yowl of joy from Uist and Theophilus' musical laugh.Tired eyes looked up at them from the other bed. With an effort, Xavier pulled back his lips into his unique smile."Are you well, beloved?" he asked, concern colouring his voice."I have missed you so much, my husband," Theophilus confessed, moving to nestle closer, careful not to jar his love."Let me hold you, my heart," Xavier said huskily.As Theophilus carefully positioned himself to be cradled in his mate's arms, he gave way to the tears he'd fought so hard to restrain.Uist caught the look from the reptilian as he held the shaking body tightly."We will let our family know and guard your privacy," Uist said, guiding Sholto to the door.Xavier knew he was too weak to love his beloved blond the way Theophilus needed, but he was more than capable of improvising."Denude yourself," he commanded in tones that, although softly spoken, brokered no argument. As his golden lover stood naked before him, he held out a hand in invitation. "Stretch yourself over me, straddle my waist." He was obeyed unhesitatingly, the smaller male careful to avoid any areas of injury. He was now able to stroke his tongue in and out of Theophilus' mouth and fondle at a slowly burgeoning arousal. He let his tail slide sinuously along a smooth inner thigh to tease at the tight opening hidden from his sight. Already his mate was lubricating and Xavier's slender appendage slid inside. Normally the reptilian would pump his spiralled tail in and out of his mate's sheath but his strength was rapidly failing. Instead he relied on Theophilus, the blond rotating slim hips and gently thrusting, and ensured his tail never lessened its insistent pressure on Theophilus' jewel. The golden eyes of his mate conveyed all the love Xavier could ever wish for and was as healing to the reptilian as any, more conventional, medication.The combined sensations from his husband's tongue, hand and tail had Theophilus teetering on the precipice of completion. His body stiffened as he reached his zenith and then he plummeted into bliss. His body shook with the ferocity of his release; his pearlescent seed spreading warm and wet over Xavier's body."I am sorry, my sweet," Xavier murmured. "I have no further strength.""Rest, my husband," Theophilus whispered. "I will tend to your needs. Rest and recover. I love you.""Love you," Xavier husked before sliding back into sleep.Tenderly Theophilus rose from his mate's body and performed the necessary cleansing. He was certain no one except his family would have understood the overwhelming need both he and Xavier had felt to be united in body. He did not want anyone to censure their behaviour, concerned that he might be prohibited from looking after his mate. He did not, however, move the beds back to their original positions, sure that he could hardly be criticised for wanting to hold his husband's hand.****Tristam came to visit the lovers and give Xavier a second dose of healing nanobots. Assured by Theophilus that he was able to care for his husband, Tristam ordered the medical staff leave the couple alone once a new saline drip had been affixed. He then joined the rest of his team and Darius'. As he and the others pored over the tapes, Rayner glanced up at a signal from Sholto and the two left the room."What is it?" Rayner asked the other human as he was led by a determined Sholto in a clearly designed direction."Something has niggled at me for ages and I couldn't put my finger on what. Now I think I know, and it's not good," he said with a sigh. He stopped and faced his friend and brother-of-the-heart. "The note left for Xavier," Sholto clarified. "I missed it, we all missed it, yet now it screams at me so obviously.""What does?" Rayner asked, wondering what they could have missed and why it was causing Sholto such agitation.'When you look at Theophilus, what do you see?" Sholto asked, puzzling Rayner even further."Um... a tall, blond, beautiful male," Rayner replied."Exactly, yet we all know that he is only on the cusp of full maturity. Although he reached his majority, as it used to be set on Drega, years ago he could still be regarded as a child. The note instructed the 'Dregan child' to be left in their room. Who could possibly know that Theophilus has yet to fully mature mentally? Who would couch a letter expecting their instruction to have been obeyed because on their homeworld a father can still make demands of a husband regarding his child?"Rayner's eyes were wide."He was removed," he gasped."Was he?" Sholto asked. "I want to see the tapes of when he was escorted from this complex . Only then will I believe he's gone. Given all that Theophilus has endured, I don't want any word of this to reach him till we know. If I'm right..."Sholto left the rest of his sentence unfinished. Rayner didn't need to hear it. Already a cold feeling was uncoiling in his gut. As he raced with Sholto towards the spaceport, he prayed that Sholto's theory was wrong.****"You cannot be serious," Tristam blazed angrily. He was holding by the thinnest of threads to his barely contained fury, aware that if his temper snapped there would be no one able to stop the snarling Uist from shredding Marlok into bloody strips."Telleran is dead," Marlok snapped. "I secured the tape as I knew you would wish and reviewed it with security myself. Telleran opens his door and recognises his visitor. We cannot see a face, but waist length blond hair is visible." He pointed an accusing finger at the huddled Theophilus who stared with unseeing eyes. "When the visitor leaves, the face still cannot be clearly seen, but the hair can. That was just 30 minutes before the body was found. As a consideration to his injured husband, I have brought him here rather than arrest him in the medical facility. I even left one of my men to guard your lizard. I am confident that when the security tapes of that area are reviewed we will find Theophilus is missing.""Bring your proof here," Darius instructed. "We've not made progress with the tape of the stairs because it has been spliced with film of inferior quality. So long as that hasn't happened a second time, I'll be able to prove Theophilus' innocence. In the meantime..." The black man moved slowly and carefully towards the shell-shocked blond sitting between two huge guards. "Theophilus, would you agree to my holding you in protective custody? It would mean cuffing yourself to me?" Darius felt his heart constrict as the dazed look was replaced by one of infinite sadness.<br/>"I will do whatever is asked of me," Theophilus replied. "Just please, Tristam, can Xavier be told? He will worry if he does not know what has happened to me if he wakes and I am gone"Unknowingly, Tristam's mind followed the same path as Sholto's. Although the blond fully participated in all they did, he was suddenly mindful of Theophilus' actual youthfulness. He knelt before the blond, cupping the smooth cheeks and rubbed his forehead against the chilled brow."I will ensure he knows. Furthermore, I promise you will be proven innocent. I have no doubts you are innocent. Be brave a little longer, beautiful.""I am so very scared," Theophilus whispered so quietly that Tristam needed to open his hearing to be certain of the words. In response, he was enveloped in a tight hug as the bigger blond fought to keep his emotion in check. Tristam knew that Theophilus needed strength and action, not tears."I swear you will be safe, Theophilus," he said. "He will not resist, Darius," Tristam added, standing back to let the other man affix cuffs that bound the blond's right wrist to his left. A mournful yowl from Uist accompanyed the unwanted action."I want him jailed," Marlok said shrilly."Attempt to touch him and I will kill you and any others who come near," Uist growled, drawing himself to his full height and unsheathing long, deadly claws."This is still an Elite investigation, although I will now defer to Darius," Tristam said. "No attempt will be made to remove Theophilus from this complex, but I will not allow him to be jailed without seeing proof of his guilt." He glared at Marlok threateningly. "And a grainy security picture of an unrecognisable figure with long hair will not constitute proof."Whilst the tapes were secured, Tristam went to Xavier and explained to the distraught reptilian."He needs me," Xavier said trying ineffectually to rise from the bed."I cannot disagree with you," Tristam conceded. "However, you are not well enough. Uist and I will not leave him without a Protector. Darius is a good man. Trust us, my brother, we will not allow harm to befall your beloved."Xavier clutched desperately at Tristam's hand, his eyes begging in ways he was unable to put into words."I understand," Tristam said, squeezing tightly to the large hand holding his. "I promise," he added, knowing exactly what was needed.****Returning to the room in which he had left Theophilus Tristam's heart ached each time he gazed into uncomprehending and saddened gold eyes. Uist hovered continually, his hands reaching to give physical reassurance. Tristam wondered briefly where his mate and Sholto had disappeared to and hoped they would have success if following up on a lead. Whatever it was, he could feel his lover was not in danger, however he was very agitated."Everything's ready," Darius said. "Let me get a good still of our man and take it from there." Darius had set up his computer system so that his findings were projected on the wall therefore everyone in the room could see. Jameson was sitting stone-faced next to Marlok and the two burly security guards were still present. One of Darius' men was there, keeping a watchful eye on Theophilus as well as Tristam and Uist. There were more than enough to protect the blond if Marlok acted foolishly. "Here we go," he said.Everyone watched as the computer's pointing device roamed over the form. The screen then split into two and alongside the grainy still, a digital image of a body took shape. Darius looked at the measurements that appeared beneath the image. "Whoever that is it's not our boy," he crowed, "and I'll prove it," he finished, freezing Marlok's objection before it could be vocalised. "Up you get, Theophilus," he said, his tone softer. He smiled coldly at the liaison as Marlok watched him run a scanner over the slender form. "I can already tell you that the man on screen is bigger both in height and width than Theophilus," he said as the computer created a second image alongside the first. "If it's a Dregan, he's bigger and probably older than our boy. Yes!" he exclaimed as the second set of figures were lower than the first. "And if that isn't enough, let me show you what happens if I try and superimpose Theophilus' image over the one from the tape." The computer attempted to complete its instruction, but in big red capital letters, the screen flashed 'NO MATCH'."Then what does this mean?" Marlok asked. He believed the case already closed. He didn't want to have to tell the delegates that there had been a murder for which they had no suspect."Let me just try and do something with the other views." Darius said distractedly. He was still cuffed to the blond, focused more on proving Theophilus' innocence than releasing him. As he projected a cleaned up image on the screen, several things happened so fast they merged into one. Uist and Tristam's howls of fury coincided with a cry of denial from Theophilus. Darius knew Dregans were stronger than humans, but he was unprepared to be yanked across the room as the blond stood and backed away from the screen, staring as though he'd seen a phantom. The last event, as Darius recovered his equilibrium, was the inrushing figures of Sholto and Rayner who shouted together:"Marcellus never left Terra II."All eyes returned to the screen. As though well aware he was being filmed, the blond wig slightly askew displaying his silver hair, Marcellous was looking at the camera, a malicious smile on his face.Jameson turned furiously to Marlok."You said he was under house arrest. You assured me he was deported. Explain this!""I...I cannot," Marlok wailed. "I was told the man I had was Marcellous. I'd never seen him." All of Marlok's superciliousness had evaporated. "I will have an investigation commenced...""*You* will do *nothing*," Jameson roared. "Put this man under arrest," he ordered the security guards. Aware that Jameson outranked Marlok, the men hastened to obey, not willing to be caught up in their supervisor's misdemeanour. "Darius, you will head up the investigation into how Marcellous failed to be removed."Darius nodded from where he currently stood removing the cuffs from Theophilus. However, as he released the blond, Theophilus moaned piteously, hands clutching tightly to his chest."Xavier," he cried. Catching all by surprise he fled from the room, his family in rapid pursuit. He threw himself into the medical facility, saw the doctor trying to compress Xavier's chest in a recognised CPR manoeuvre and heard the words;"...not responding...dead..." before crumpling slowly to the floor.****"Wake up, come on, come back to us," An insistent voice buzzed maddeningly and a slender hand came to up try and flail ineffectually to rid the unwilling listener of the unwanted noise. "Come on, all the way back. That's it,"A concerned face surrounded by dark and lighter blond hair came into shaky view. A reassuring smile changed the countenance."That's better,"With wakefulness came awareness and a heartbreaking moan of loss spilled from pale lips.Uist gasped as the slim armful burrowed into his chest."He is dead. What will I do without him?""Shh, shh, little one," Uist said affectionately. "You're forgetting a very vital component of reptilian physiology. Xavier's body was already highly sensitised being in healing mode. When it detected the toxin, he immediately went into hibernation. The medical staff here mistook it for some kind of seizure and because they couldn't immediately get respiration or heartbeat, they thought he was dead. The activity dislodged the saline drip which housed the poison. Xavier is fine, beautiful. Tristam is overseeing what he will permit the medics here to do. Xavier's going to be a little weak when he wakes next, but he is fine.""Truly?" Theophilus asked, his eyes wide and shining with hope."Truly," Uist smiled. The big man didn't release his hold on the blond as Jameson came to sit next to them. Both men knew this was likely to be the lull before the storm of emotion.It took a second or two before all of what he'd been told was fully processed by Theophilus."Toxin?" he asked suddenly. "But who would...." Theophilus' voice trailed off. He shook his head as realisation crashed around him. Tears fell unchecked.His father.Marcellus.It could not be another. He gripped tightly to Uist as Jameson wrapped his arms around them both. Each man tried to offer comfort as best they could, glad that the blond sought succour from them.Once Theophilus felt sufficiently recovered, he carefully pulled back from the two men to stand and look sadly at them and the rest of his family who had remained standing a discreet distance from the three males."I offer you my resignation from the team, Commander," he said formally, looking at Tristam. "I would not have you debar my husband from continuing with you if he desires. I will be content to remain wherever can be considered home. I will understand if Earth, Phixia or PrideHome do not wish to have me there." His head dropped and Theophilus waited for a reply.Tristam and Jameson were stunned by the words. It fell to Sholto, as the young man drew on his vast store of cultural information, to understand and be able to reply on everyone's behalf."Theophilus," he said, coming to stand by his blond brother and taking a firm grip of one of the slender arms. "You are not Marcellus.""But I am his son..." the other male began."As is the father so are the sons," Sholto intoned flatly. "Whatever crime Marcellus is deemed guilty of is considered to apply equally to his male offspring." Sholto turned to the rest of the group as he explained. "Theophilus believes that since we are certain Marcellus is a murderer and has attempted to murder Xavier, we will regard him in the same way."Tristam moved swiftly to envelop Theophilus in a tight hug."That is not the case," he said. He released the blond as Jameson came forward. The mature human lifted Theophilus' head to look directly into eyes that now held a small glimmer of hope."Remember when you first encountered Marcellus here?" he asked gently. "Remember what you told him? You considered me more of a father to you than him. You call *me* your papa and I, and your brothers and sisters, both here and the others Aurora and I have fostered, have been proud and privileged to have you in our family and to watch you mature. You are not Marcellus and never could be. You are intelligent, compassionate, and courageous and have a strong sense of justice. You could not be more my son if Aurora had given birth to you herself. You carry the same qualities I see in all my sons." Jameson held tight to the blond as Theophilus hugged him hard. He smiled encouragingly as Theophilus drew back to take a deep breath before speaking."Thank you, papa," Theophilus said huskily. "I love you all so much, my family," he said gazing at each man in turn. They were all so different, one from another as much as from him, yet they were *his* family. "I promise I will do nothing to purposely bring hurt or shame to you. I will not let your faith in, or love for, me be misplaced or regretted.""Do not feel anything Marcellus may have done in the past or will do in the future reflects on you in any way. You are Theophilus. You are not and never will be Marcellus or anything like him," Uist said, coming to stand by the blond.Theophilus gave a smile as his family gathered around him. He hugged them all in turn, letting himself be comforted by their presence and love."Now I think you need to resume your care of your husband," Jameson smiled."I will stand as sentinel," Uist growled, "until we can be certain of Marcellus' whereabouts.****Jameson came to sit next to Tristam. A full search had been undertaken to locate Marcellus, but a review of shuttles departing Terra II following the attack on Xavier had shown the Dregan had already left. Jameson had been in contact with Drega whilst the conference had continued, another delegate designated to replace Telleran. Jameson was not happy at the news he had to impart to his son."You're unhappy," Tristam said, not even needing to use his enhanced senses. Jameson's anger and distress were almost palpable."I have spoken to the Dregans," Jameson said. "They have said that Marcellus' name missing from the delegate listings was an oversight on their part. He was here with full government permission. We have no actual proof that Marcellus is guilty of the attack on me, the explosion or the attempted murder of Xavier. I could only say that we felt it possible he was involved, which they refuted vehemently. 'Marcellus is Patriarch of a well-respected, powerful dynasty and sire to one of your own Elite,' Jameson quoted. They have suggested someone was trying to blacken his name as a counter-theory. As far as Telleran is concerned, Marcellus visited him with their knowledge. Marcellus was trying to make him conclude the deal as he should have done. They deem Telleran murdered by person or persons unknown. They have exonerated Terra II of all responsibility for the death and will deal internally with the deceased's family. The trade deal has been concluded to mutual satisfaction and Terra II has no need to continue with any investigations. Therefore Terra sees Drega as an extremely benevolent, as well as powerful, ally. As such, Marlok has told me he wants all tapes returning to him and our investigations to cease. He wants us offworld as soon as possible.""Do you think Marcellus is a government assassin?" Tristam asked baldly."Don't you?" the older human countered.They sat silently for a few moments, as Tristam considered his options. No matter which way his mind turned, the conclusion was always the same."I have no choice. If Terra won't cooperate, we can't force them. At the end of the day, they are not responsible for what happened to us.""I doubt we would find anything more than we already have. I think we were dealing with someone who has a great deal of experience and who won't have left any loose ends," Jameson said. "It's going to be hard on Theophilus, so I've contacted Xavier's family. You are all expected there to allow you, and especially Xavier and Theophilus, time to rest and recuperate. If I can, I'll try and join you. If I can't, come back to Earth for a few days.""I'll get things moving," Tristam nodded.****EpilogueTheophilus lay naked next to his husband. Xavier was stretched under the bright sun of Phixia, enjoying its heat and warmth. A large parasol kept the blond in shade. Xavier pulled the unresisting form to lie so they were on their sides facing each other. There had been no physical contact other than gentle healing touches from his mate and Xavier was becoming concerned. Consequently, Tristam and Rayner were out on the lake and Uist and Sholto were walking together, giving the reptilian an opportunity to speak privately with his mate."Speak to me, beloved," Xavier urged. "I have missed our intimacy, not just of the flesh but of the spirit.""I am sorry, my husband," Theophilus said sadly. "I know my family said I was not to give consideration to Marcellus' actions on me as an individual, but I feel his taint. I have his blood in my veins; things can never be the same again.""Things change and we change with them and move on. It is said, it is always darkest before the dawn. We have come through dark times, but we have emerged again into the light. You know of the love of your family and you will always have mine. Whatever sins may be accountable to Marcellus, none are against you. I love you. I love Theophilus, whose love and beauty shine brighter than the sun above us. Let me show you, my heart. Let us banish this shadow between us by the light of our love.""I need you so much," Theophilus whimpered. He had been afraid to initiate intimacy, in part concerned his husband was still too weak and in part because he feared rejection. Xavier's words had his arousal building rapidly.Xavier trilled so low as to sound as though growling at his mate."Kneel astride my body," Xavier husked, directing the blond so that wide-spread thighs were either side of his shoulders. He pulled apart taut, pale globes. His tongue flicked at the tiny pink portal, lubricant already beginning to drip free, testament to the level of the blond's need. Xavier slowly ran his forked tongue over furled flesh. He ran the flat of his tongue over Theophilus' entrance and along his cleft. His beloved made a sweet little noise, so Xavier did it again, and again, until the blond was wriggling and pushing back, moaning and gasping. The reptilian teased his mate, flicking the forked tip of his tongue back and forth until Theophilus begged him for more. Xavier honoured the request, pressing his tongue inside. Just the tip, then he pulled it back out licking around the entrance and the irresistible nether cheeks. The next time he pressed in with more of his tongue before withdrawing it, then even more, until he was thrusting inside as hard and as deep as he could. His mate had spread his long legs impossibly wider, as he squirmed at Xavier's ministrations. Xavier's tongue pushed deep into the velvet channel then swept back and forth over Theophilus' hidden jewel. Xavier pulled it out, pushed it back inside, out and in, finding his lover's pleasure spot over and over; working it until Theophilus was mindlessly pushing back, lost in sexual bliss. One last sweep over Theophilus' sweet spot and he felt his beloved come apart. Warm, wetness bathed his chest as Theophilus' body trembled in its release. Gently the reptilian eased his lover to lie down, stroking smooth skin until the aftershocks had ceased."Husband," Theophilus moaned softly. "I would have you inside me.""It will be my pleasure," Xavier husked. The large reptilian loomed over his mate as Theophilus spread his legs wide in silent invitation. Taking hold of Theophilus' hips, Xavier pulled him up onto his strongly muscled thighs. He unsheathed a single hemipenis, pressing the glistening flesh against the dilated, irised portal. He pushed until the still tight ring was breached. Theophilus jerked in reaction and squirmed in an incredibly provocative fashion against Xavier's thighs.The younger male groaned low in his chest as Xavier's length drove slowly but steadily into him. He was awash with powerful emotion and sensation. Vulnerable and overwhelmed he surrendered to the sought-after siege, throwing open his gates and welcoming the amorous invader. He was so transported that he scarcely felt the hard, hot length. Then his mate altered the angle of his stroke and Theophilus' back arched as though a laser blast had been detonated through his spine.Xavier took a firm hold of Theophilus' slim hips and increased the tempo of his deep thrusts. The young man moaned helplessly as Xavier's shaft dragged insistently across his most sensitive flesh sending bolts of sheer erotic bliss scorching up his spine to explode like a supernova in his reawakening groin. Theophilus made a strangled sound, and his hips bucked against Xavier's muscular thighs engulfing more of the hard rod."Both, I would have both," Theophilus pleaded. "I want all of you.""Then you shall have your desire, my beloved," Xavier rasped.The reptilian looked down into gold eyes dewy with desire, the devastatingly beautiful face transported by bliss. Golden hair fanned out in all directions, catching the sun and shining even more brightly. He faltered in his stroke as he inserted his second organ and the blond moved restlessly, trying to capture more of the pleasure-giving flesh that filled him so agreeably."No," Theophilus panted. "Don't stop."Xavier's twin penises pulsed in the tight passage. As Theophilus twisted on his thighs he gave a mindless sob of need. The tenuous control that the reptilian was holding slipped at the raw sound of pure desire. He had achieved his goal, to make his beloved mate forget everything except the love and pleasure they could share. He wrapped his tail across the wide-spread, supple thighs to curl around his mate's renewed erection, squeezing rhythmically and thrust hard to rub his lover's jewel. Incredibly powerful muscles clenched and relaxed as he lunged and withdrew. The blond gasped and cried out at each stroke, the soft, urgent noises sweet music in Xavier's aural depressions.<br/>The reptilian leant down and claimed Theophilus' mouth, taking possession with his tongue. The younger male made a small desperate noise as the agile organ flicked in and out of his mouth and pumped his hips frantically to indicate his enjoyment of the sensual ravishment. Xavier's tail released smooth thighs and wound further around Theophilus' straining rod, contracting and relaxing with increasing fervour. Abandoning the sweet mouth to nip carefully with sharp teeth at the tender flesh of Theophilus' neck, Xavier formed his knot, preparing to release at the same time as the blond he could feel rapidly approaching his zenith.Theophilus froze for a long moment poised on the edge of an unending abyss. The young man wailed, digging his fingers into the earth as both rods slid deeper. He wrapped his legs around the bulk of his mate as Xavier drove vigorously into him and then shuddered violently through a cataclysmic climax. Hot, pearly fluid fountained free spreading warmly against his sweat-sheened chest.Xavier gave a joyous trill to match the cry of ecstasy from his beloved and pressed his teeth with infinite care into the curve of Theophilus' neck.The blond was shaking, helpless in his passion, and clutching at broad shoulders as Xavier's seed spooled hotly deep inside him. He felt Theophilus lick at his skin as his lover's sheath clamped down on the hard lengths stretching it.Xavier groaned appreciatively as the clenching channel tried to milk his twin sexes, demanding he spill every last precious drop of his seed inside his mate. Panting, Xavier collapsed alongside Theophilus, nuzzling the damp neck, stroking the blond mane dreamily in the euphoric lassitude that followed the aftermath of their powerful climaxes."Love you, love you, my husband," Theophilus gasped, caressing languorously at his mate's lilac frill."I love you, my heart," Xavier replied, reaching with arms and tail to envelop as much of the satiated mammal as he could. "I always will." He felt his mate slip into sleep and drew back his lips in a smile. Theophilus would emerge stronger from this trial, they all would. As hard as it seemed while the wounds were still raw, they would all heal together. He looked forward to the rest of his family joining him and his mate so the real healing could begin.

<p><b>Chapter 5: Son and Lover</b></p><p><i>Pelaam©: October 2007.</i></p><p>Tristam had avoided any cases for just over six weeks. They had all suffered, leaving them both mentally and physically drained, from the events on Terra II. As the team's commanding officer, as well as their being his family, he knew they needed to relax fully. He especially needed to know Theophilus was capable of resuming his place, and full participation, before a new mission was accepted. Things had been particularly hard on the blond. However Tristam, and the others, had been pleased and proud at the way the young Dregan had recovered.</p><p>He had watched as the haunted look in expressive golden eyes had slowly been replaced by his normal confidence. He and Uist, in particular, had spent a great deal of time both together and individually with Theophilus, assuring him of their love for him and his unwavering place in their lives. Rayner and Sholto had ensured that the three of them had plenty of relaxing times as well as fun, not letting Theophilus duck out of anything they had planned. Throughout it all, Xavier had stood back, allowing his extended family help heal his mate, letting Tristam know how much he was grateful for their united care.</p><p>To some degree, Tristam now felt he no longer had any choice. Jameson had contacted them to say they had some strong, reliable information on a slaver the Elite had long wanted to catch: The Sheik. So named because he wore long, flowing robes and a turban wrapped around his head and face to preserve his anonymity. The thought of young, helpless men and women snatched from their homes and family to be slaves, of one kind or another, had Tristam particularly distressed. He desperately wanted his to be the Lead Team.</p><p>Although to some degree breaking a slaving ring was a 'fire-fighting' exercise, the more they broke the more lives they saved, even if the trade didn't cease. He knew Theophilus had a strongly compassionate nature and would not be approaching the blond if he had not already spoken to Xavier, both as husband and physician, and been assured that Theophilus was ready to work again. Taking the young Dregan to one side, he had not even finished his talk before Theophilus was almost begging for them to take on the mission and for him to be allowed to participate. He had been so proud of the less mature male's attitude and commitment. They had hugged tightly before he had sent Theophilus to Xavier and he had contacted Jameson. Now they were heading to rendezvous with the older man.</p><p>****</p><p>In their quarters, Tristam laid side-by-side with his beloved husband. Their hands traced random patterns on each other's skin and they smiled gently. Rayner pushed his bigger mate onto his back and kissed him thoroughly, straddling over the broad, golden-tanned body.</p><p>"Thank you," he murmured, nuzzling at Tristam's throat. "For making Theophilus so happy."</p><p>"What did I do?" Tristam asked, his voice a deep, sinful rasp. "I want to make sure to do it again if this is my reward."</p><p>Rayner laughed softly, his tongue then meandering down his husband's throat to his chest where he finally sucked contentedly on a dark pink nub.</p><p>"Although he is much improved, knowing you wanted him to participate in this case, to still be a part of the team, meant so much to him." Rayner said. He felt the discontent even as it began in the older man's mind. "Hush, love," he admonished, nipping at the succulent nubbin to a small gasp. "You know it is a part of his heritage. Sholto has spent a lot of time teaching Theophilus some of his world's more modern history and customs. He had never revisited Drega, even through computer, from the day Xavier took him as his mate. He understands, intellectually, his world has moved on. But he still finds himself tied by what he was brought up to think and accept. The change is happening, both for the planet and for Theophilus, slowly. This is the start. When you think about it, he never expected to have to face anything to do with Drega again when Marcellous effectively cast him aside."</p><p>Tristam nodded slowly. That was something he had not considered. He could now understand some of Theophilus' feelings. The blond Dregan had subconsciously held onto a measure of his origins when faced with an unknown universe, whereas he himself had no idea of his own. Whoever had taken him and made him into a hybrid of human and PrideHomer was also unknown, as were their ultimate intentions towards him; although a human who could see, hear and smell as well as the cat-race had obvious advantages in certain situations. But he had only come to be able to control his abilities with the care and compassion shown by Jameson and Aurora. When first in their home, they had spent untold numbers of days retreating to a room where it could be light, sound and smell free. His mastery of his senses came from love, devotion and determination. He doubted whether if he had remained a prisoner, he would be sane or even alive.</p><p>"Hey," Rayner murmured softly, effectively breaking into the older man's thoughts.</p><p>"I love you, angel," Tristam said. "You are so very, very special." He rolled their bodies and began to caress his lover's soft, honey-tinted skin. Mouth and tongue began to follow the trail of his hands until his face was buried in the dark nest of curls that adorned a smooth, erect penis. Tristam rumbled his approval as Rayner spread his legs wide and the bigger male licked around Rayner's sac and shaft. He could taste and scent his mate's musk and arousal. Tendrils of pleasure from his lover's mind slipped into his own, increasing their mutual stimulation.</p><p>"Feels good," Rayner whispered, his hands caressing Tristam's head and shoulders. "Oh, that's nice," he gasped as his husband's talented tongue swirled around the reddened head of his shaft. His hips moved in desultory thrusts and he enjoyed the feeling of his lover's warm, wet mouth around his erection. "Make love with me," he murmured.</p><p>"Always," Tristam vowed, reaching for the oil they used. Kneeling between Rayner's splayed thighs; the big male thoroughly coated his fingers. He leant down to kiss his beautiful love as he probed delicately between smooth nether cheeks. He caressed the tightly furled rosette that granted him entry to his mate's body before reaching inside the hot, tight channel. They let their shared pleasure ebb and flow between their minds as Tristam tenderly prepared Rayner's body amongst adoring kisses and words of love and devotion. As he stroked his fingers across his mate's jewel, it was almost as electrifying as having his own touched as Rayner shared the mental delight with him. All too quickly, however, their bodies demanded more.</p><p>Rayner embraced his husband as the bigger man positioned his sex against Rayner's prepared portal.</p><p>"Make us one, Tristam," he begged. His moan of pleasure was echoed by his mate's as two bodies united. Slowly everything else slipped away, all that existed was tight heat and the flow of joy between them as the lovers sought to be as one physically, mentally and spiritually. Their bodies moved in a silent harmony, dancing to music as old as time that only they could hear. Soft sounds of need and pleasure added to the melody. Their hips undulated in synchronised movements, driving them both to a shattering crescendo and the outpouring of their combined seed. Rayner coated their bodies and Tristam filled his husband with his release, each man vocalising shared joy. For long moments they lay together, content to simply bask in their orgasmic afterglow.</p><p>"I love you, Tristam," Rayner said quietly, his voice laced with satiated pleasure.</p><p>"I love you," Tristam replied instantly. He manoeuvred their bodies to lie facing his beloved. He kissed reddened, swollen lips. "I don't like this mission. Even though I know I want to do it," the older man confessed. "You, Sholto and Theophilus are all young and beautiful enough to catch the eye of this man and you will be where he can reach you."</p><p>"And we will be watched over by you, Uist and Xavier. You can be with us in moments if anything happened we couldn't control."</p><p>"I just don't like deliberately putting any of you in jeopardy. I never have and never will."</p><p>"Any of us could refuse and, in case you've forgotten, it was our idea to make ourselves prominent in the hopes we *do* catch his attention. I trust you. I trust all of you. Anyway, all we'll be doing initially is gathering data and allowing ourselves to be seen in what we believe to be his most usual haunts. How dangerous can that be?"</p><p>"Dangerous enough," Tristam growled, gathering the lithe form close. Something was making him feel very protective. Putting it down to concern for his mate's and chosen brothers' safety, Tristam settled them both snugly. As Rayner slept, he mounted vigil.</p><p>****</p><p>In another part of the ship, Uist was feeling the same level of inexplicable protectiveness. He had barely let Sholto further than arm's reach since Tristam had confirmed they had accepted the mission. Additionally, he had felt it necessary to check out those to whom he was Protector. Rayner and Theophilus had been happy to accept his need as simply part of his nature and he had been grateful for their forbearance.</p><p>He nipped gently at the creamy, fur-dusted mounds that were before his avaricious eyes. His lover was on his hands and knees, his head pillowed on his arms. The cat-man's tongue slid slowly down the exposed cleft once more, teasing the younger human and he growled approvingly as Sholto pushed back, silently demanding more. Their combined scent of arousal and desire was a potent aphrodisiac and this time Uist's tongue thrust greedily inside his mate to taste further.</p><p>Sholto moaned his appreciation as he felt the thick, slick, agile muscle push inside him. His lover's protectiveness had resulted in a day of touches and caresses that had kept the young man's arousal simmering. As tempting as it had been to haul Uist into their den and love him senseless earlier, Sholto knew if he let nature take its course, waiting until Uist was at the edge of his control, it would be even better. Already his mate's tongue had mapped out every inch of his body, leaving not a millimetre that unlicked. The undivided, erotic attention had driven Sholto to his first climax. He was again hard, dripping and eager, but Uist was still wetting him, stretching him, using his sinfully talented tongue to drive Sholto to the edge of the precipice over and over. It was amatory torture and Sholto loved it, loved Uist, and loved the way his big mate could play his body to perfection.</p><p>"More, please, love," he whimpered, pushing back. "Oh, yeah, gooood," Sholto gave a guttural groan as thick, oil-drenched fingers replaced his mate's tongue. They swept over his jewel repeatedly until the young man was almost incoherent with need and his pleas were unintelligible except on a primal level.</p><p>Satisfied with his effect on his adored husband, Uist lined up his slickened sex against the entrancing entrance and finally pushed inside the tight channel. For a moment he let both of them relish the feeling of being as one and then began to thrust in long, slow, deep movements, each one dragging over his mate's sweet spot until Sholto was shaking with need. Uist watched his shaft slide in and out of his lover before pulling the smaller body to sit astride his strongly muscled thighs. In this position all the control was his. He used powerful haunches to drive himself into Sholto's body, holding tight to the smaller man with one hand and pumping the rock-hard rod between his mate's legs with the other. His kissed and nipped at the fragile throat, bared for his ministrations. He could feel and scent how close his lover was.</p><p>"Come for me, mine," he rasped in Sholto's ear, his voice low and thick with arousal.</p><p>The sound, as much as the words, was enough for the younger male. Stars danced before Sholto's eyes and his body shook with the ferocity of his release, his seed fountaining over the bed. He felt his body clamp brutally around the flesh impaling him and he moaned wantonly as hot, wet juices filled him. He felt thoroughly debauched and totally sated. His limbs were leaden and he simply let his husband position him as the cat-man desired.</p><p>"That's nice," he mumbled, as his mate's sinful tongue rasped over his body, licking him clean. Then he was tucked securely up against Uist's large, strong body.</p><p>"I love you, mine," Uist rumbled.</p><p>"I love you, too," Sholto replied, nuzzling against Uist's shoulder.</p><p>"Sleep safe," Uist whispered, as he felt Sholto slip into slumber. As he kissed his mate's temple, apprehension tickled at the periphery of his awareness. Those he loved were purposely undertaking dangerous work and he had to permit it. His grip tightened around the lithe form. He vowed to be especially vigilant.</p><p>****</p><p>In the ship's pool, Theophilus and Xavier were enjoying relaxing in the water. Theophilus had felt a little off-colour and, given the upcoming case, neither male were unduly surprised. The idea to play in the pool was Xavier's and Theophilus was grateful to his husband and feeling himself once more. He laughed joyously as his mate's tail snaked between his spread thighs as he trod water and tickled at his perineum. Strong arms enveloped him and he was carried, laughing and kissing Xavier, into shallower water. Theophilus murmured his pleasure as his mate's tail slipped between his cheeks to thrust gently into his rapidly dilating body.</p><p>"You are easily aroused today, my heart," Xavier whispered, before his tongue slid in and out of the blond's willing mouth.</p><p>"I love you so much, my husband," Theophilus replied. "It seems I just cannot get enough of you and your touches. I am ... apprehensive ... about this mission. I do not want to let any of you down perhaps that is why I feel I need you so much."</p><p>"Put it from your mind and let me love you, my sweet. We can talk in our nest," Xavier crooned.</p><p>"Yes, oh yes, yes," Theophilus' words became a chant as Xavier's tail was replaced by his twin sexes. Theophilus knew how close he was and unsurprised his lover formed his knot instantly. Xavier's tail wound around his aching erection and within three rhythmic contractions his climax erupted. He heard Xavier's trill of completion as he cried his husband's name and he felt the reptilian's seed flood his still spasming channel. He slumped replete in strong, loving arms.</p><p>"So tired," he murmured. He often felt drained after they made love but, at that moment, he felt incapable of keeping his eyes open.</p><p>"You are worrying about the mission too much," Xavier whispered. "Let your body tell you what you need. Do not push yourself too hard. I will carry you to our nest and when you wake we will talk." The lizard gave his unique smile as Theophilus' head snuggled into his shoulder and a soft, unintelligible murmur was his only reply. Xavier hoped his mate did not worry himself into exhaustion.</p><p>****</p><p>From their meeting with Jameson, the six returned to 'Silver' with chips, tapes and even some paper records all with information on, or believed to concern, the slaver they sought. Whilst Tristam, Uist and Xavier remained on the main deck, piloting the ship and discussing the ways they could best help protect their mates, Sholto, Rayner and Theophilus were closeted away, making themselves familiar with every piece of data. With their nemesis preserving anonymity, they could not always be certain the reports concerned the same man. Sholto offered the thought that there could be more than one as some of the information seemed too old to relate to the same individual.</p><p>"I will return quickly, my brothers," Theophilus excused himself, smiling reassuringly as Sholto and Rayner looked up. He quickly headed for the ship's medical centre, knowing his mate was on the command deck. It was distasteful to him to be secretive towards his husband or his family. However, he had not felt himself for a couple of weeks. He was certain he was not ill, but perhaps still feeling some lingering effect from the time at Terra II. He desperately needed to undertake this mission and did not want the overly protective, more mature males, leaving him out. He ran a simple blood test; not wanting to do anything that Xavier could find and question him about.</p><p>He stared at the result and quickly ran a second. The result did not change. //It cannot be// he thought to himself, but he knew the results did not lie. He buried his face in his hands for a moment and then stood up straight. He could manage this. It had already been decided that if they had no success within a week, they would need to withdraw and begin again. //A week is no time at all. I can wait that long. I shall wait that long.// He shut down the computer terminal, but in his stunned state failed to stop the machine automatically saving the results. He selected some medicinal herbs that would help fortify his system and then returned to Sholto and Rayner.</p><p>"These are the space station bars that our man seems to prefer," Sholto said as Theophilus joined them once more. "There are three of them. We thought we could work in pairs," he explained. "You and me, Rayner and me and you and Rayner. Does that seem fair?"</p><p>"I am quite happy," Theophilus nodded. He smiled at the two humans so beloved to him. He was making the right decision. A week would make no difference.</p><p>****</p><p>It was the end of a tiring and distasteful day. Three protective males sat at the poolside as their mates swam and splashed, both cleansing and comforting themselves following the day's events. Once the three young men were dry and dressed once more, they convened a meeting with the Leader of the Elite they would be working closest with.</p><p>Darius was pleased to find he was as welcomed by the attractive Dregan and his hovering reptilian mate as by the others of Tristam's team. He had held some lingering concerns that either Theophilus or Xavier may not have been happy to work alongside the man who had put the blond into custody when accused of murder, however, Theophilus had treated him affectionately and warmly.</p><p>"How did you fare, guys?" he asked as they sat around the circular table. At the looks that passed between them, Darius guessed it had not been pleasant.</p><p>"We spoke privately to the bar owners. Only one owns and runs his bar, the others employ managers to do the work," Rayner said. "The two run by managers were by far the ... seedier." He gave a shudder and Tristam and Uist growled at the implied memory. Rayner gave them a wry smile.</p><p>"One of the owners, despite seeing both mine and Theophilus' Elite Security ID chips, actually asked me if I was interested in 'selling' Theophilus," Sholto said. This time three males gave the impression of growling, Xavier's frill becoming redder and his trill low and menacing. "A young Dregan is almost unheard of out here and, of course, Theophilus is exceptionally beautiful." Sholto grinned at his brother, who stared at him with wide eyes.</p><p>"Sholto, please," Theophilus murmured, a crimson blush stealing over his face.</p><p>"My mate speaks true," Uist rumbled. "We each have a beautiful husband and we regularly experience avarice and deal with it. However, this goes beyond normal jealousies."</p><p>"The one who owns and runs his bar seemed helpful." Theophilus spoke, his colour slowly returning to normal. "He wishes to keep a 'clean bar' as he put it. He is happy for us to sit and watch for the Sheik. He was even willing to point out the man if we missed him. With the other two, I think it would be advisable to have undercover Elite stake them out. I do not think we would be supported, or particularly safe, in their establishments."</p><p>"I think our other teams could also find it profitable to enquire into the background of someone as foolish as to proposition Sholto so brazenly," Xavier said, the lizard's anger making his voice brittle.<br/></p>"I think credit signs made him speak without thinking," Sholto said. "He was almost unable to take his eyes off our brother to form coherent speech. Anyway, we therefore thought it best to remain in the bar of Barlok, who seemed affable enough, and stick to being there in pairs over the next several days. We can make covert notes of all who visit the bar and, between the three of us, be there during its opening hours.""You have given things a great deal of thought and discovered some interesting sidelines for us to follow up on," Tristam said, nodding approvingly at them each in turn. "You are all certain you want to go ahead with this? No one wants to step back a little and follow up other leads?" Tristam was not surprised when all three insisted they wished to focus on their prime miscreant. "Ok then," he smiled grimly. "We go ahead as you've outlined and Darius will select undercover agents for the other bars as well as someone to follow up this other man. What was his name again?" he asked Sholto."Lokai," the auburn-haired young man said, his voice laced with distaste.****In their nest, Xavier diligently loved his beautiful mate. His tail was deep in tight, slick heat, its tip caressing Theophilus' sensitive jewel. His tongue encircled the head of the smooth arousal, the forked organ flicking rhythmically over the rosy flesh to mewls of pleasure and delight as the blond thrashed wildly. His golden hair was spread luxuriantly over the cushions and pillows catching a myriad of colours from the lamps Xavier had lit. A delicate pinch to a reddened nipple sent Theophilus over the edge, Xavier's name on his kiss-swollen lips. Carefully, Xavier's formidable maw swallowed all Theophilus could offer."Beautiful," the reptilian husked. "So very, very beautiful." His large hands swept lovingly over heated skin to wordless murmurs of appreciation. Xavier could see his beloved was completely spent from the intensity of his climax. He gave a mental frown. His young mate was tiring too easily. He was concerned Theophilus was pushing himself too hard. His tongue slid over the blond's throat. Even his taste seemed to be subtly altered. He cradled Theophilus to his chest. "Be safe, my heart," he whispered. "Come home into my arms where you belong." He carded a hand through the blond mane, pressing random kisses to his mate as he did, not wanting to waste a moment of time with the most precious thing in his life. He would catch up on his rest the next day. For now he intended to drink deep of his husband's beauty and enjoy the feeling of the sated, soft and warm body in his embrace.****Rayner and Theophilus sat as unobtrusively as possible in Barlok's bar. Theophilus wore a mantle to hide his tresses. Although the young men had dressed dowdily, in an effort to appear needy, their beauty was unmistakable. Rayner gave a small smile at remembering Barlok's warning that Theophilus was a rare catch and suggesting someone else be found to take his place. Theophilus coughed discreetly as he saw the barman scurrying over, a tray of fresh drinks in his hand."I've had a very good shout your man is both in town and has cargo. The Sheik is renowned to be both a successful trapper as well as courier.""Trapper? Courier?" Theophilus queried as he took the drinks from the tray."'Tis easy enough to catch prey, the men and women that is," Barlok explained. "Couriering them to their destination 'tis the more dangerous. 'Tis where the bigger money is made.""So the man we seek is both." Rayner said. "The sooner he's stopped the better.""Others have tried before, my brother," Theophilus warned."Your friend here would be worth a King's ransom," Barlok said thumbing in Theophilus' direction. "I'm glad ye at least covered his hair.""There would be instant retribution if any tried to harm Theophilus," Rayner warned. "Apart from being under the protection of Elite membership, he has a husband and Protectors who would deal with would-be kidnappers." Rayner was not sure whether Barlok was warning or coveting. In this place it seemed friendship was bought and sold, just another commodity to trade."Just making sure ye know what you're doing, boys," Barlok said, shaking his head. "There's those around here would sell their grannies to slavers if 'twould earn them the price of another round of drinks, or the price of a ride out of this station. Young boys like you shouldn't be here. 'Tis dangerous enough for those that know the place and call it home, 'tis not for the likes of ye."Rayner could not help but smile as Barlok went back to the bar, shaking his head."Perhaps I misjudge him," Rayner said softly."He seems inoffensive, but so many eyes watch us, my brother. I feel it." Theophilus sipped carefully on the fruit juice he had selected. Some things made him queasy quickly and he was having difficulty selecting what was and was not safe here. It was not a good option, the taste too tart, and Theophilus eyed distastefully where the bathrooms were located."Not alone," warned Rayner. "We get fresh drinks on our return."Theophilus felt miserable as he pushed back his tresses and wiped at his face. He was almost never nauseous and it left him feeling shaky. He flushed the less than clean facility and then stepped outside the stall. He frowned as he did not see Rayner. He moved towards the sink and glanced into the dirty, stained mirror. The reflected sight of his friend on the floor had him whirling with a distressed cry but, even as his hand sought his weapon, he felt the dart penetrate his throat and he dropped soundlessly to the floor."Two for one," the robed and turbaned figure rasped as he appeared from his place crouched above an empty stall. "Lokai has earned a bonus." He removed the wrist communicators with a barked laugh, dropping them contemptuously to the floor. He slung the blond over a shoulder and the brunette he tucked under an arm. He exited as he had entered, via a door that appeared secured from the inside.Barlok glanced over to the table where the boys should be sitting. They still had not returned. A cold dread washed over him. He hurried to the washrooms and stared inside. Two communicators lay on the floor. As he looked at them he felt a cool breeze on his back and turned with a soft moan of denial. His shoulders slumped as he went to retrieve the discarded equipment and then to the bar to make a call.****Barlok had been discomfited at the menacing presence of the big blond human male and more than nervous by the attitude of the PrideHomer, but it was the Phixian, whose species he had only ever seen as placid, who terrified him. The great lizard pacing angrily, tail lashing, frill raised and vermillion, whirled on him once more."Are you certain you saw and heard nothing?" the reptilian demanded."If you have played any part in the abduction, I will kill you ... slowly," the PrideHomer hissed in his ear, turning Barlok's bowels to water. He shook his head frantically, his mouth too dry to speak. He had no doubt the threat would be made good and he could almost feel sorry for whoever was involved.Almost. Because he would gladly have given these men a name, if he had one, to save himself.The three males had combed every inch of his washrooms, but had come away empty-handed. He had, however, overheard them muttering about a vaguely familiar scent, but one they were unable to place. Barlok wanted to appease them. He wanted to be as far away from them as possible."I had a good call the Sheik was in town. I told them to be careful. Such pretty ones'd turn anyone's head," Barlok began to babble. "No one knows his name. He's a dangerous man. I've heard he's killed many who tried to take him in. I'm sure the reason he hides behind that turban is as much to hide his scar ..." As Barlok gabbled on he ran a hand diagonally down his face in imitation of a jagged mark. If he had been terrified before, there was no word to describe his level of fear as the human and PrideHomer threw back their heads uttering inhuman cries of fury and the shriek that came from the Phixian was a sound Barlok prayed he never heard the likes of again. He was certain he would hear those sounds in his nightmares for months to come. As the three flew from his premises, the PrideHomer's voice was the last he heard and it turned his marrow to ice."He is a dead man."****Theophilus awoke slowly. As consciousness returned, he remembered what had happened to him and Rayner. He could hear no one else in the room and opened his eyes carefully. He felt light-headed and nauseous, each seeming to fuel the other. The drug was clearly taking a long time to clear from his delicate system. He sat up, holding his stomach as it protested the motion. He was surprised to find he was in a sleeping quarters. He had expected to be in a cell. His hair had been freed from its mantle, but nothing else seemed out of place. He stared with disgust at the clothing laid out next to him; a gold chest harness and a diaphanous gold kilt. The kind of clothing a pleasure slave would wear. He swept them to the floor angrily. Nothing would induce him to wear such items.The door opened and the Sheik entered. He began to unwind the turban as Theophilus watched him as a bird would a snake."It has taken a long time to have you in my bed," he said, his voice muffled, yet frighteningly familiar to the blond."Marcellous," Theophilus gasped as the black cloth fell away to reveal the man beneath. The younger male felt his stomach rebel at the sight and he clutched at it, giving a soft moan of both distress and pain."Your consorting with inferior species, like the humans, has made you weak," Marcellous huffed impatiently. "I will need to build your resilience.""I want nothing from you," Theophilus replied, forcing himself to stand and move away from the bed. "I will do nothing you desire.""Oh but you will," Marcellous said silkily. "You may not want to, or even enjoy it to begin with, but I have tools, toys and drugs at my disposal back home. You will be willing enough ... eventually."Theophilus could scarcely believe he was hearing such things and his head shook mutely as his lithe frame shook with shock."You were the most beautiful of my sons, and the most pliant," Marcellous said. "My plan was to allow you to marry and then your spouse would meet with an untimely accident. No one on Drega would question you returning to your father under such tragic circumstances. From there to my bed, where I would have comforted you, and thence to working alongside me. You turn the heads of many species. That would be valuable in my ... alternative trades. I may still be able to use you in that way, once you're trained.""My family will come after me," Theophilus said bravely, trying to quell the icy fear at Marcellous callous words."I'm sure they will. In fact, I'm counting on it."Theophilus looked stunned."I dose my cargo with a little concoction that permanently wipes three to five days of memories. Pretty little Rayner won't remember whether you were with him on the transport or not. I will make sure word reaches the right ears for him to be found. A few judicious words in avaricious circles and the news of a Dregan on the market will spread like wildfire. Of course, you will never be there. Your precious 'family' will simply waste their time trying to find you, when you will be nice and safe back home on Drega."Theophilus' head dropped. It seemed his father had planned this as immaculately as their early encounter. However, Marcellous did not know everything and the blond made sure he kept his stance submissive, as if resigned to his fate."Might I spend some time with Rayner, father?" he asked, raising his eyes just a little, dredging his memories for those things in his childhood that had earned him affection or cooperation from the silver-haired man."But of course. I would not deny you your opportunity to say farewell." Marcellous said magnanimously. "Not that your 'brother' will remember. Your wrists, child," he commanded.Theophilus walked forward, keeping his head bowed, and meekly held out his wrists. There was no point fighting here and now. He knew he was still weak and dizzy. There would be time when he was stronger. There *had* to be.****Rayner, along with the other half dozen captives, looked up from their cell floor as Marcellous brought the manacled Theophilus. The brunette's heart ached at the look of defeat and exhaustion on the blond's face. Their cell was locked by thick metal-barred gates, rather than an electronic field, but it occurred to him that it might be harder to explain such a large, secure space. It seemed likely that the metal gates could be removed, when there was no cargo, leaving open space that no one would question. At the snapped command, they shuffled back. Their hands, like Theophilus, were manacled, but the chain was attached to their manacled ankles."You have a day to make your farewells," Marcellous said silkily, as he locked the gate behind the blond.Theophilus waited till he could no longer hear his father's footsteps."You are unhurt, my brother?" he asked anxiously. "And these young ones are well?""We're all fine," Rayner assured. "He takes very great care not to damage the merchandise. Are you...?""I am unhurt and ... untouched. Although he has ... plans.""They're coming, Theophilus," Rayner said emphatically. "You know that don't you?""I know," Theophilus smiled. "His intent is to drug you and the others so you will not remember me being here. Let word reach our family of where to find you and for them to assume I would be there also whilst he takes me to Drega.""Not going to happen," Rayner assured."I have to get free. I have to stop him. I cannot let his taint be a part of me.""It isn't, Theophilus," Rayner began, but stopped as Theophilus made a halting confession. "Oh, Theophilus," Rayner continued. "You should have told us sooner," the brunette said, wishing he could hug the blond. "You shouldn't have had to deal with this alone.""I could not. It was important to show I belonged with you. Now it is important I do something to stop Marcellous. You do understand?" he asked.Rayner gazed up at the beautiful face on which were etched tiredness, concern and a tinge of hope and he nodded, smiling."I understand, but you must take no unnecessary risks. They are close, my brother," Rayner said, closing his eyes and his smile widening. "Very close.""I can unfasten the manacles and maybe the gates, too," a young, beautiful woman offered. "If you promise to help us escape," she added."We'll return everyone to their families or take them to a place of safety," Rayner said. He and Theophilus then stared as she manipulated her wrist until a small piece of metal wire appeared. She then used her teeth to pull it free. Rayner could see the sight had made the blond queasy. "Theophilus sit down a while," he said concerned. "This will take several minutes."The blond obeyed. The smell of the place, its oppression and the sight of the wire being teased from frail flesh had made him feel ill. He longed to feel his husband's strong arms around him. He closed his eyes, dropping his head onto his knees and wishing he was safe with Xavier, remembering just how loved he was.****Aboard 'Silver', Xavier was checking the medical facilities, ensuring anything and everything he might need was exactly where he knew to find it. He found it impossible to just sit on the command deck. An unscheduled use of the medical computer had him run off the last reading. He stared at it. He threw back his head, his roar echoing around the rooms and he raced to his family.Tristam, Uist and Sholto were stunned by the reptilian's appearance and his agitated state."Xavier, what is it, what's wrong?" Tristam asked worriedly."Theophilus," Xavier husked dryly. "My beloved. He carries our child. He is pregnant." The lizard looked at each of his stunned family, before an agonised howl broke free from Uist.Tristam grasped the reptilian's arm."We will reach them in time. I swear it," he said. He glanced at Uist and Sholto. Both men's fingers flew over 'Silver's' controls and he felt a surge as the ship's speed increased.The images of two PrideHomers appeared onscreen. The older was Uist's sire, Willis, the younger his sibling Steffen. Uist had wasted no time in declaring Bloodfeud on Marcellous when they had realised he was the Sheik they sought. He had immediately contacted his sire, who had been en route to Earth and the older PrideHomer had instantly changed course and was now closing in on Marcellous from a lateral direction. At the news concerning Theophilus the older male growled menacingly."If he harms my son or my first grandchild I will make him beg for death," he rumbled. As Uist was a Protector to the Dregan, so Uist's family took the blond to their heart as if he had been born of their familial pride. Family was of great importance to PrideHomers. "We are closest to the ship you identified. We will give him the offer of surrender. Will he know, my son?" he asked of Xavier, looking with sympathetic eyes at the distraught male."I do not think so," Xavier said haltingly. "Theophilus would not reveal it to him for fear of Marcellous' reaction ... one way or another. It would be a potent weapon to ensure my husband's cooperation. But his body will be trying to take care of the life he carries. He will tire quickly as it devotes energy to the growing baby. Now I understand why his scent seemed subtly different, his hormones were changing. Why did I not see it sooner?" he moaned softly."For the same reason Tristam and I reacted protectively to his changed scent and did not know why. This has come as a surprise to us all. Although once he and the child are safe and well, I will speak personally to him for not telling us sooner," Uist growled, his protective instincts surging and making him agitated. He looked at his mate, as a hand squeezed his arm gently, and he reached to hold Sholto."He still fears Marcellous' taint," Sholto spoke up. "He was desperate to prove himself to us. He had no way of knowing how things would turn out, or who the Sheik was going to be. I don't want anyone telling him off for the way he acted. He will be consumed with guilt enough." The auburn head turned to look pointedly at the three bigger males and a loud guffaw came from the view screen."Well spoken, little one," Willis said. "I would agree with him.""You are right," Xavier said. "We will need to treat him very gently. This will have taken a great toll on him."Uist still growled, but nodded his acceptance. He doubted whether when face-to-face with his beloved brother he would be able to do anything other than hold him tightly.****Marcellous sat at his command console. His legs splayed wide, leggings around his ankles. His hand stroked languidly up and down a long, thick, hard length as he smiled coldly. He was looking forward to the conclusion of another successful delivery ... and the unexpected bonus that had come into his possession. He growled angrily as he was alerted to the presence of another ship heading towards him and its desire to contact him. He stood, yanking his leggings back up and stuffing his still-erect penis inside. His tunic hid his arousal and he flicked on his communications. It had always paid not to arouse undue attention by refusing to accept calls. However, the image that would appear on the other ship's view screen was not his. He stared at the face of a PrideHomer, one that seemed vaguely familiar. This was something completely unexpected. The Dregan frowned. He disliked surprises."I am Willis, sire to Uist who is Protector of Theophilus. Under PrideHome law this makes Theophilus as a son to me and a part of my pride. Any attack on him, or those he holds as family, is an attack on me and mine and will be met with whatever force is deemed necessary. My firstborn has invoked Bloodfeud. If the boy is aboard your vessel, and has suffered any harm, blood will be avenged. I offer you the opportunity to stop and surrender. "<br/>Marcellous quickly flicked off the image and activated the secondary engines. His ship flew forward. He was close to his destination and he doubted anyone would fire on him if they believed they might hurt Theophilus. The ship suddenly began to shudder and slow. Marcellous hit the console over and over, but got no response. He viewed the cargo holding area, unsurprised to find it empty."Perhaps you are more of an adversary that I anticipated, my son," Marcellous acknowledged grudgingly. "But you will not stop me." He left his command centre and headed for his shuttle hangar. Marcellous ran down the slope to the control panel that activated the inner and outer doors. He moved swiftly to his shuttle as the outer doors began to open. However, he heard them stop and turned to find Theophilus barred his way."You have a choice, child," Marcellous said menacingly. "Stand aside and I will let you go. This time. If you try to oppose me, I will not hesitate to do whatever it takes to defeat you.""I am an Elite officer and you are a wanted felon. I will not let you escape justice. Surrender and you will be given a fair trial.""You are a fool, Theophilus. Do you honestly believe you can defeat me? You will either end up with me on the shuttle, or dead, if you stand against me."Theophilus was not certain he could overwhelm his father in a fight; however, he could not stand by and let the older man get away. He owed it to himself, his unborn and to his family to try and at least contain Marcellous until help could arrive."I do not fear you, Marcellous," he said quietly. "I am not the child that you cast aside on Drega. It is my duty to oppose you and place you under arrest."The two Dregans met in a battle that pitched youth and speed against age and cunning. Theophilus was also aware that most of his moves were defensive, instinct making him protect the life he carried. The dance was deadly in its intent. He knew Marcellous was a desperate man. An unexpected manoeuvre caught Theophilus unawares and, as he lost coordination, a kick landed in his groin, dropping him instantly. He rolled to protect his stomach as the older man followed up with another brutal kick, catching the blond hard in the lower back.Marcellous resumed opening the hangar's external doors and then went to begin powering up his shuttle. He would drag Theophilus aboard once all systems were fully engaged.Theophilus gave a grunt of pain and despair. He was crawling towards the slope and safety, but his body was demanding he rest. The hangar's inner doors had now begun to open slowly and the drag was almost impossible for him to fight in his weakened state. He gave a whimper as he inched forward just a little more and then a loved voice reached his ears over the sounds of the doors."Theophilus. Here. Reach for me."Tristam was bending low, his hand stretching towards him. Theophilus could see that, in his turn, Tristam was held by the welcomed sight of a pale-green hand. With his last strength, the blond reached and clutched desperately at Tristam's hand and felt himself being pulled to safety."No. He is *mine*." Marcellous' furious bellow came from the shuttle doors. The Dregan's strength was displayed as he strode towards them, the opening doors seemingly unaffecting him.Tristam almost had Theophilus safe as Marcellous reached them. With a cry of rage and denial, his grip was easily broken by the silver-haired male. The blond too exhausted to resist as he was pulled from Tristam's grasp and carried towards the shuttle."Xavier, let me go, I won't lose him," Tristam shouted, angry that Theophilus' mate would be hauling him away. However, as he was pulled through the doorway, he saw the reason.Steffen ran through swiftly, heading for the wall-mounted control panel, as two huge, furred forms, growling angrily, bounded past Tristam and Xavier.Tristam recognised Uist immediately and could only assume the other was Willis. He watched as Marcellous shrieked in terror, shoving Theophilus at one beast as he tried to dodge under his shuttle away from the other. Theophilus was caught and swung into a gentle embrace by Uist as Willis dove after Marcellous. The great beast brought the barely conscious blond to where Tristam and Xavier waited and tenderly laid him in his husband's arms. A massive paw with deadly claws carefully caressed Theophilus' belly, causing the blond's golden eyes to flutter open and a weak hand to cover the paw."Our baby," he whispered, his eyes focusing on his husband. "Is he well?"The beast gave a contented purr before leaving them and Tristan replaced the paw with his own hand. He could smell what he now knew was the slightly more musky scent of the blond that denoted pregnancy. His hearing could pick up the tiny heartbeat of the life beneath his hand and he smiled."Very well. He is as strong as the one who bears him. Take care of him, Xavier," he added, nodding away from the unfolding events on the hangar deck.Xavier did not hesitate. Whilst he trusted Tristam's assessment, the big blond was not a physician. He wanted to check his beloved out personally and ensure their child was indeed well. As he strode towards 'Silver', he halted as Sholto came running towards him."Rayner and I have secured Marcellous' 'cargo' aboard the ship. They will need checking over when you're ready." His hand reached for Theophilus' stomach and the blond managed to cover it with his own. Sholto gazed anxiously at Xavier."I believe my beloved and our child are both well, if exhausted." The reptilian answered the unspoken question and received a wide grin. "I will tend to those who need me after settling my mate."Sholto then joined Tristam who was gazing down into the shuttle hanger."It's over," the blond said, without moving. Sholto laid his hand on Tristam's arm and was pulled into a tight embrace. "It could so easily have been you and Theophilus he took," Tristam said, kissing Sholto's brow. "We could have lost you both." Tristam inhaled the familiar scent, taking comfort in the arms that returned his hug with equal strength. Without the link he shared with Rayner, they would never have been able to track Marcellous."But you didn't. Rayner is with the others Marcellous was planning to sell into slavery. Go to him. You need each other. I'll look after things here. It will take a few minutes for Uist to resume his form and I don't know how quickly Willis can resume his."With a final kiss to a much beloved brother, Tristam nodded and left. Sholto smiled at the retreating figure and then grinned at the huge male, still in primal form, that stood and purred happily at him."Well done, big guy," Sholto said, sitting on the floor. "Come and lie here whilst you change." As he looked up, Sholto's blue eyes widened. Normally after assuming the primitive shape, Uist was tired. However, Sholto was staring at a large, ruby-red headed erection that jutted proudly from the beast's furred groin. It would not be the first time he and Uist had mated when his husband was still in his other form, but it was rare. Uist dropped to his hands and knees and, as the big male's head pushed into Sholto's groin, the sounds of snuffling mingled with rhythmic purring, Sholto was fairly certain what was prompting the need to mate. It had long been decided that he, Rayner and Theophilus would bear their children at the same time. The recent proximity of a pregnant blond was tripping all of his mate's instincts to sire his own child."Not going to happen without Xavier's assistance, lover," Sholto smiled, as he began to unfasten his clothing. He slapped off the claws that tried to simply rend the clothing that stood in the way of skin-to-skin contact. "No way, Uist. I am not greeting your sire and sibling naked."The purrs increased in intensity as Sholto removed the last of his clothes and lay back naked and erect. He spread his legs wide, silently telling the dominant male he was willing to mate. His reward was a sound between a yowl and a purr before the long, rasping tongue began to tease at his nipples. As the tongue moved lower, claws, wielded with infinite care, scratched at the taut teats and the sensitive insides of out flung thighs. His lover's tongue lapped away all of the addictive silvery trails before moving lower still.Uist nosed at his mate's groin happily. The copious pre-come was both an aphrodisiac and an indicator of his mate's level of arousal. A primal part of him wanted to mate, to sire his own pride. Another acknowledged that, although this was not the right time, it would be soon and so the beast was appeased. He thrust his tongue between his mate's cheeks, unerringly seeking the tiny portal. He lapped assiduously around it, relaxing and pleasuring Sholto, before thrusting deep inside his love's body, stretching and slicking the tight sheath.Sholto knew the rhythmic purring was an integral part of relaxing him. He closed his eyes, hands reaching to stroke and pet at his mate's furred body, trusting that Uist would take care of him. He moaned as the long, agile muscle flicked over his sweet spot before rubbing it in earnest. Sholto bucked and writhed, but was easily held by the bigger male, until certain he was going to come. He whined his disappointment as Uist's tongue withdrew. His legs were then hooked over strong arms and the broad head of Uist's sex pushed against his opening.The big male hesitated. Waiting. Intense amber eyes locked with oceanic blue."Yes, Uist, yes please," Sholto pleaded.With a drawn-out yowl of unbridled joy, the bigger male slid into his mate's body. He held still, waiting as the tight sheath rippled and stretched to accommodate his length and girth. His size was greater in this form and so he took more care with his lover's smaller body. A hitch of slender hips told him Sholto was ready and he began to move. From slow undulations to long, deep strokes, Uist made love with his adored husband. He relished each and every cry, moan and mewl from Sholto. The combined scents of musk and desire were heady and potent in fuelling the cat-man to mate with and claim that which was his. He bit down on Sholto's bared throat, sucking, wanting his mark on his lover and feeling strong fingers dig into his back in response. He released Sholto's legs and they wrapped around his waist, as best they could. He felt Sholto use the leverage to move in counterpoint to his powerful thrusts. It was enough to send him over the edge. With a roar that seemed to echo for long minutes, he erupted, filling his mate with his seed.Sholto heard Uist reach his peak and cried out as wet heat filled him. It triggered his own cataclysmic climax. Wailing Uist's name he came hard, vision greying, pleasure firing through every cell and synapse to leave him completely drained and fully satiated. He murmured wordlessly as Uist's tongue began to lick him clean, the purring man replacing the purring beast.Sholto felt himself be lifted and buried his head into Uist's shoulder, barely able to keep his eyes open."I love you, Sholto," Uist said softly."Love you," Sholto whispered. He gave a groan burying his head deeper as he heard a familiar voice speak."Your sibling and I will wait for you outside, my son. I want to be sure of Theophilus' health before we do anything further." Willis' voice held a trace of amusement as he and Steffen left the mated pair."They have gone," Uist said, restrained laughter colouring his voice, as he lowered a crimson-cheeked Sholto to the floor."So much for them *not* seeing me buck naked," the younger man growled, pulling on the carefully removed clothing. He glowered at his snickering mate, which only resulted in a full laugh. Unable to remain either indignant or angry in the face of Uist's obvious joy, Sholto joined in the laughter.Willis and Steffen were waiting as they promised. They ruffled Sholto's hair playfully and rubbed their cheeks against his before doing the same with Uist."Marcellous will not harm any of mine again," Willis said, his deep voice resonating with satisfaction."Our blood is avenged," Steffen said, nodding."It is as it should be," Uist confirmed, holding tightly to his mate.****EpilogueRayner lay in lush foliage, relishing not just the perfect level of heat and the scent of the exotic flowers surrounding him, but the talented mouth that worked his erection. His hand stroked Tristam's hair as his husband made love to him with lips and hands. A talented tongue slid up and down his length, swirling slowly over the head. He felt Tristam drink down his salty elixir as drop after drop was teased from the tiny slit. His husband's hand cupped his sac, tenderly rolling the precious orbs within which ached for release. He cried softly as Tristam brought him to the edge over and over. Finally he tugged on the shaggy mane."Be inside me," he begged.Tristam moved to mate their mouths, letting his lithe lover taste himself. He moved lower to suck and nip at chocolate nipples haloed with coffee areolae as he reached into the oil he had ready nearby. As his tongue moved in abstract patterns over his mate's smooth, honey-tinted skin, Tristam's finger sought the tiny entrance hidden in the downy declivity of the beloved body. Rayner's pleasured sounds increased as Tristam slid a lone digit inside, a second finger joined the first, and his mate's hidden jewel was caressed again and again until once more Rayner was panting and pleading."Ride me," Tristam husked, as he withdrew his fingers from molten depths. He lay back, watching avidly as his mate straddled him. Gentle fingers coated his aching length with oil, reaching to massage his sac, heavy with its unspent need.Rising up, Rayner positioned Tristam's hard flesh at his prepared portal and shimmied to push the engorged head past the initial defences of his own body. Slowly he eased down, his internal muscles clenching and releasing to deeper and deeper guttural groans from his husband. Finally he was fully impaled and he gazed down, adoration in his deep brown eyes. He smiled as Tristam caressed his abdomen. It was not his time yet, but very soon; Tristam's paternal instincts were as strong as those of Uist and, if Rayner were honest, he wanted to carry his husband's child. He slowly undulated and rotated his hips, giving a soft laugh as Tristam groaned again."Imp," Tristam growled. He smiled at the gasp from his lover as he stroked and squeezed the elegant erection as it bobbed gracefully in time with Rayner's motions. "I love you," he added, flicking his thumb over the head of the engorged flesh in just the way he knew would drive Rayner wild. It was his mate's turn to groan as he partnered the movement with an upward snap of his hips.Rayner shifted slightly, a pleased cry escaping his kiss-swollen lips as his mate's shaft rubbed him perfectly. The time for teasing was past. He began to move faster, lifting and lowering higher and harder to increasingly harsh breathing from them both. He threw his head back enjoying the feeling of fullness, the stimulation to his sweet spot, the touch of his mate's hand, as well as of his mind. It was perfection. Multicoloured supernovae detonated behind his closed eyes, heat and need radiated from his groin and with a cry of Tristam's name, his release jetted over his lover's fur-dusted chest.Tristam could feel in his mind, body and heart that his lover was reaching his climax. He hitched his hips, wanting, needing to be as deep inside as he could get. He cried out Rayner's name at almost the same second as Rayner climaxed, his cream filling the clenching sheath that enveloped his pulsating shaft. He caught his lover as Rayner slumped forward and for long minutes the lovers simply basked in the languorous afterglow.Eventually they arose gracefully and wrapped the sarongs on which they had lain back around their hips. Each with an arm around the other, they ambled slowly into a large clearing filled with a wide assortment of people. They smiled as they looked at their family. Jameson and Aurora were sitting with Xavier's parents and Uist's sire and they went to join them."Is it true we no longer have to fear Marcellous?" Aurora asked. She had feared the Dregan would in some way try to reclaim the blond she considered her son."It is true," Willis purred. "He died at my hand and his body was sucked out into space. It is fitting there will be no place of rest for him."Tristam cast a quick glance at Uist who sat nearby, clearly listening to the conversation. He saw the other man's head nod and then their eyes met. Tristam was the only other who knew that Willis had actually thrown the still-living Dregan through the space doors before Steffen had shut them. No one, other than Jameson, of those present knew Marcellous had been the Sheik, and nobody ever would. Marcellous' ship had been destroyed. It would simply be as though the older man had vanished. By Dregan law after one year and a day, if Marcellous did not make a return, his estate would be shared amongst his sons. Tristam knew Theophilus had wanted no part of the wealth, but was instead persuaded to use his portion to benefit those whom Marcellous would have preyed upon and to create additional scholarships for talented Dregans to both Phixian and PrideHomer universities.Theophilus and Xavier came into view. The blond's hair was still wet from swimming with the reptilian and he looked radiant. At the sight of the gathered group, Theophilus gave a cry of surprise and delight. They had chosen to spend time on PrideHome to recuperate, but Xavier had made no mention of his own family arriving, or of the presence of Jameson and Aurora. He was swept into loving embraces, his still-flat stomach tenderly caressed by all."It is a wonderful surprise to have you all here," Theophilus said, his smile incandescent. He settled himself with Rayner and Sholto as the others watched Steffen play Xavier's younger brother Yve at a Phixian game of logic and strategy.Tristam was engrossed by the game and vaguely aware that Rayner, Sholto and Theophilus had moved away from the main group. He could feel his husband's joy filtering in and out of his mind and he smiled contentedly. Within the next couple of weeks Xavier would implant an artificial womb into Sholto. As soon as it was certain it had taken, he would then fuse cells from the couple to create their child. Then it would be Rayner's and his turn. He was already eagerly anticipating the pregnancies. He became more and more involved in the duel between PrideHomer and Phixian, watching as despite Steffen's best efforts he was beaten soundly.Steffen looked up with a growl which, as he looked at Tristam, became a snicker. At his side Yve tried to be polite, but at Theophilus' musical laugh and Sholto and Rayner's more baritone mirth, he too joined in. As other voices were added, Tristam reached upwards, finally feeling ... something. His hand encountered the crown of flowers that had been delicately placed.With an expert pounce, he captured his mate, who was almost helpless with laughter. Although he expected to be tackled by Theophilus and Sholto he found Steffen and Yve adding to the melee."I yield," he laughed, as he was easily rolled and pinned to the ground. He looked up at those above him, smiling affectionately. Four very divergent worlds and peoples were linked by one beautiful blond. He caressed Theophilus' joyful face before doing the same to Sholto and then pulling Rayner down for a long kiss. He was aware of the mixture of sighs and snickers from those around him and he let it wash over him. The love they all shared was almost palpable at that moment. He gazed up into Rayner's eyes and saw the depth of emotion they held. He sighed his bliss; he had the love of his mate and his family. What else did a man need?

<p><b>6: Mirrored Image</b></p><p><i>Pelaam(c): January 2008.</i></p><p>Aboard 'Silver Star' the three couples were making their farewells. Their new mission meant that the team had to separate; something they rarely did. As Theophilus, Sholto and Rayner were all now pregnant the air was highly emotionally charged.</p><p>Sholto was just over a couple of months into his pregnancy, but already he suffered easily from pregnancy sickness, at any time of day. As consequence of which Uist was highly protective of, and exceptionally careful with, his young mate. Anticipating the need for a prolonged farewell with his husband, Sholto had already taken an anti-emetic especially created for him by Xavier. It meant he was now able to remain on their bed on his hands and knees, legs spread wide as Uist's tongue bathed his body. He groaned softly as his auburn hair was wrapped around a strong hand to bare the nape of his neck. Sharp teeth bit gently before a rasping tongue licked over the exposed surface. It moved across his shoulders, swept across his back and laved creamy, fur-dusted globes. This time Sholto's moan was deeper, more wanton.</p><p>"More, please," he pleaded, pushing back to try and impale himself on the slick, agile muscle that teased so enticingly. He gave a soft cry as the circling tongue began to push inside his body. He groaned his frustration as the welcome invader was withdrawn.</p><p>"Gently, mine," Uist purred, rubbing circles over Sholto's back. He oiled two fingers and slid them into his mate's molten heat, relishing the moan and the pungent scent of musk and arousal. His own shaft was almost purple-headed with its need, liquid desire pooling on the bed as he carefully excited and prepared his lover. He knew he needed to take care of his husband in more ways than one. The hard, fast loving he would normally favour if parting from the young human was now not possible. Sholto was having a hard time carrying their child and the cat-man would do nothing to jeopardise either precious life.</p><p>"Want you so much," Sholto murmured, pushing back against the delving digits. "Love you so much."</p><p>"I love you, too, Sholto," Uist rasped, as he eased a third finger alongside the others still stretching and slicking the tight channel. Slowly, tenderly, the big male eased Sholto backward, sliding his hardness into the prepared sheath to soft whimpers of his name. He then manoeuvred Sholto astride his thighs where the smaller man was only able to accept being loved at Uist's pace.</p><p>Sholto groaned his appreciation as he finally sat flush on hard, furred thighs. He let his head fall back onto a broad shoulder, letting Uist control everything. He murmured wordless encouragements as Uist's body undulated gently, massaging his sweet spot. One of his husband's hands rolled one nipple then its twin whilst the other stroked him in concert with the rubbing against his prostate. Sholto's head rolled from side-to-side as he reached back to hold Uist's shoulders. He was hovering on the brink of orgasm and whimpered his need.</p><p>"Come for me," a dark, seductive, possessive voice husked into his ear and he was powerless to do anything but obey.</p><p>He cried Uist's name as his seed arced from his body. He felt his channel clamp on the hard flesh impaling him as Uist's roar heralded the rush of his mate's essence pulsing inside him. He felt his husband's teeth fasten on his shoulder accompanied by a hard sucking and knew he was being marked.</p><p>He was laid down carefully on the bed and Uist's gentle, thorough tongue rasped once more over his body. He was then cradled to the cat-man's powerful chest and nestled closely. He knew that during the mission Uist would be working with Xavier, whilst Tristam would be in more danger as he would be alone, but he still fretted about his mate's safety. His altering hormones made him emotionally vulnerable. He wrapped his arm across Uist. Lovemaking tired him as quickly as it did Theophilus and he felt himself losing the battle to keep his eyes open.</p><p>"Sleep a while, my love," he dimly heard Uist's soft purr.</p><p>Uist stroked his mate's auburn hair as Sholto slept. As a PrideHomer it went against all of his instincts to leave his pregnant mate, but this was a critical mission. Only a tiny number within the Elite even knew of its existence. He knew the younger men would all be taken care of by Jameson and Aurora; spoilt, in fact. However, he still disliked leaving any of them. He pressed a kiss to Sholto's temple. The sooner it began, the sooner it would be over.</p><p>****</p><p>Tristam was as equally caring of his newly pregnant young husband. They had only just been given permission by Xavier to make love and Tristam was taking no chances with Rayner's comfort. The younger man was on his side, Tristam spooned up tightly behind him. The bigger man's fingers tenderly prepared his lover as he sucked on Rayner's earlobe eliciting appreciative shivers of arousal from the lithe brunette.</p><p>Rayner writhed as his manhood hardened at Tristam's slow, soft touches. Mental pleasure ebbed and flowed between them until Rayner was uncertain whether he felt his own happiness or Tristam's. He could feel his lover's flesh as a hard, hot brand against his nether cheeks as Tristam's fingers worked their magic to ready him to accept his husband's sex. One of his hands traced over Tristam's hip and thigh and he arched and cried out softly as Tristam's fingers caressed his jewel. The brunette then moaned as Tristam entered him with aching slowness, filling him as deeply as possible. Rayner sagged back against his bigger mate.</p><p>"That's it, angel," Tristam murmured. "Let me take care of you, love."</p><p>Tristam kept his movements slow and tender and at an unhurried pace that nudged his lover's hidden sweetness gently. He refused to give in to his baser desire to thrust harder or faster, keeping the pace steady, content to feel his lover's increasing arousal and know that they were spiralling towards a shared zenith.</p><p>"Love you, angel, love you so much. Want to come with you."</p><p>Rayner shivered at the deep guttural tone, the sound as arousing as the touches to his body. He was beyond words, beyond thinking, letting himself simply feel and trusting his mate to take care of all he needed. He came crying Tristam's name at three gentle pulls to his swollen flesh. As his own seed fountained over his husband's hand he felt wet heat fill him, Tristam moaning his name into his neck.</p><p>Rayner did not know whether it was minutes or hours later that Tristam slipped from his body and he felt his lover's sadness at the loss of their connection that echoed his own.</p><p>"I don't want to let you go. Come back safe to us, Tristam," he whispered as he turned to bury his face against his husband's broad chest. He bathed his husband's nipple with his tongue, sucking on the large nub.</p><p>"I have the greatest incentive any man could have; a beautiful husband and our unborn waiting for me. Relax, angel. Let me just hold you." Tristam's strong arms encircled Rayner. He smiled as he heard soft snuffles of sleep from his mate within minutes. However, he remained awake, holding to his precious bundle.</p><p>****</p><p>Theophilus lay languorously in the nest he shared with his husband. His hair fanned over the cushions like golden silk. His legs were spread wide and the reptilian's tail was deep inside him, caressing his sweet spot whilst a talented tongue was wrapped around his aching shaft. Theophilus arched and moaned as Xavier worked his body masterfully. The long, forked tongue moved both up and down as well as contracting and relaxing, but all movements were tender and unhurried. Theophilus shifted to be able to stroke the smooth head of his lizard mate and over the aural depressions, a sensation Xavier especially enjoyed. The blond knew he was fast approaching completion and he whimpered his mate's name over and over.</p><p>"Xavier!" Theophilus finally cried as his living essence pulsed free.</p><p>The reptilian was closely monitoring his lover and knew when his beautiful mate was reaching his climax. Mindful of his maw of sharp teeth, Xavier carefully closed his mouth over Theophilus' erection and drank down the sweet elixir. He used his tongue to milk his lover of every precious drop and then stretched alongside his husband.</p><p>Theophilus was now taking a supplement that helped to ensure he was not so easily fatigued and Xavier was hoping to bring his beloved to a second, shared climax. His tail stroked the satin skin of an inner thigh as his fingers toyed with nipples that adorned slightly swollen breasts.</p><p>"I will miss you so much, my husband," Theophilus mourned sadly, burrowing into his mate's strong arms.</p><p>"As I will miss you, my heart," Xavier replied honestly, stroking his love's tresses.</p><p>"I wish I could be with you," the blond said, his golden eyes sorrowful.</p><p>"I will have Uist, beautiful," Xavier smiled reassuringly. "You will need to take care of Rayner and Sholto. Rayner will especially worry being away from, and out of reach of, his husband. Your role here will be as every bit as important as ours, beloved."</p><p>Theophilus smiled and peppered the reptilian visage with kisses. As hard as being apart from his husband would be, he intended to take his responsibility for his more newly pregnant brothers very seriously.</p><p>"Please, my husband," he whispered, "be inside me."</p><p>"Are you able to pleasure yourself on my flesh, beloved?" Xavier asked.</p><p>Theophilus' smile became wider, a reflection of genuine happiness. He was proud of being less tired than in the first months of his pregnancy and knew how much Xavier enjoyed the sight of him astride the big reptilian. He arose gracefully, his golden hair rippling over his shoulders and down to the small of his back. He straddled his lover's large body, raising himself ready for Xavier to unsheathe his twin hemipenes. He could feel how slick and ready he was and the sensation of his mate's sexes at his entrance sent frissons of arousal throughout his lithe frame.</p><p>As Theophilus settled his body to take Xavier inside him, the lizard gave a low trill of pleasure and joy. He relished every time he was able to make love with his beautiful mate and it was especially arousing for the reptilian knowing Theophilus bore their child. His tail wrapped securely around the blond's waist as Xavier's long, sensitive fingers traced over the gentle swell of his husband's abdomen. Theophilus was already undulating and squeezing his internal muscles, driving the bigger male towards completion. Xavier cupped his mate's sac, rolling the precious orbs before stroking the slender rod that was slowly refilling to bob elegantly in time with Theophilus' movements.</p><p>Xavier's hands began to trace warm, soft skin from Theophilus' throat, across his shoulders and over his nipples, tweaking them with meticulous precision as his tail spiralled around his lover's shaft contracting and relaxing in harmony with the blond's motions. His mate's face seemed lit by a beatific glow as he worked both of them to a shared release. He gave his own smile as golden eyes ablaze with love and desire opened to look down on him.</p><p>"I love you so much, my husband."</p><p>"And I you, Theophilus," the reptilian replied.</p><p>The blond moaned, dropping his head back and pushing his chest into Xavier's touches as he felt his mate form his knot and the tail around his own erection changed movements to a ripple effect from root to tip and back again. He began to pant softly as he undulated on the hard flesh impaling him, the ripples around his aching shaft increasing incrementally with his movements. Heat suffused his body and a tingling seemed to permeate every cell before his seed flowed up in a pearlescent arc to spill over Xavier's pale-green skin.</p><p>Xavier watched as his husband reached his zenith and he was rewarded with his precious silver. With a groan of Theophilus' name, the reptilian's own elixir filled his mate's spasming sheath. Even before Xavier's orgasm had ended, Theophilus slumped and the lizard held him safely as the last of his seed filled the beautiful blond mammal. He cradled the slighter body close, smiling as Theophilus sagged completely, letting Xavier take care of both of them.</p><p>"Be safe, my husband. Come home safely with our brother," Theophilus whispered. He nestled across the broad chest of his mate, held tightly by arms and tail.</p><p>"I will return, my heart. We will all come home safe to our loved ones. But you know how important it is for Tristam to try and rescue someone who seems to have been genetically altered in the same way as he has. It has become a very personal mission to him."</p><p>"I will take care of the young ones," Theophilus vowed, as he stroked his mate's frill, earning a low purring trill of pleasure from his mate.</p><p>"I know you will, beloved," Xavier said. He was so proud of his husband. He gave silent thanks for the brave and compassionate younger male he had been so blessed with. "Sleep safe, my heart. Let me take care of you whilst I may." Xavier began a low musical trilling as he rocked his lover, feeling the caresses to his frill slowly falter and stop. He was quite certain he would not be the only one keeping a voluntary vigil over a beloved mate that night.</p><p>****</p><p>Rayner, Sholto and Theophilus paced or sat, their faces reflecting their worry. They barely registered the luxury of the apartment in which they were housed or its view of the immaculately tended parkland. They were currently willing themselves not to constantly ring their Papa. They knew Jameson was the central hub of information for all that was happening, but realised equally that he needed to be free to receive calls from their husbands rather than themselves.</p><p>Theophilus moved to stand behind Rayner and gently massage the shoulders he could see were tense with anxiety.</p><p>"Tristam will take no chances, my brother," he said in reassuring tones. "You are his world. As you are Uist's," he smiled, as Sholto ambled over to lean against him. He draped an arm around the smaller man trying to infuse both younger males with confidence.</p><p>That the sharing of comfort and support had come full circle came as no surprise to any in the room. They were all part of a diverse and extended family. When one was in need, they knew they could rely on succour from the others. Rayner stood to bury his face in a slender shoulder and a deceptively strong arm encircled him protectively.</p><p>"They will *all* come home safe," Theophilus said emphatically.</p><p>The buzz from the videophone had the three men hurrying to take the call and they held their breath anxiously at the sight of a grim-faced Jameson.</p><p>"There has been some unexpected activity at the space station that Uist and Xavier were investigating," the older human said, his eyes flicking from Sholto to Theophilus. "Communications are down and I've sent in another ship. It could be a day or so before I can communicate properly with them. As far as I have been able to establish they are unhurt, but stranded and no longer able to transmit to me."</p><p>Unconsciously, Sholto and Theophilus' hands reached to each other and their fingers entwined, each man conveying solidarity with the other.</p><p>"Do you need us to take 'Silver' out?" Rayner asked, trying to think of action they could take to help their family.</p><p>"No, Rayner," Jameson replied. "You are needed here. Tristam is already returning with his ... cargo. He has very short range communications, but I can confirm he is on his way home and all is well. He will soon rendezvous with Darius and can speak more openly then. Just a few more days, boys and this will all be successfully concluded."</p><p>"Thank you, Papa," Rayner smiled.</p><p>"I'll be in touch as soon as I hear more from your husbands, boys," Jameson said, looking at Sholto and Theophilus.</p><p>As the older human's visage faded, the three males hugged tightly. Whilst there were still some concerns over Uist and Xavier, they all believed Jameson when he said it was nearly over.</p><p>****</p><p>Sholto had opted to remain at the apartment whilst Theophilus and Rayner drove out to meet Tristam and his rescued prisoner. The entire building was monitored and protected by Elite-trained security and Jameson had felt that the freed prisoner would be more relaxed if they remained with Tristam for a day or so until less overwhelmed by their new-found liberty. Then they could all meet when Uist and Xavier returned. It was important to the older human that there was no suggestion that there had simply been an exchange from one set of jailers to another. All the two men knew of their guest was that they shared enhanced senses like Tristam and were struggling to manage control.</p><p>The dark and light men scanned the crowds looking for the man that was husband, Protector and leader. Both gasped in unison.</p><p>The couple walking towards them could have been brother and sister. Despite Tristam being over six feet in height, the blond woman at his side was only an inch or so shorter. Height, build, hair colour, the similarities were almost uncanny. Their heads were angled towards each other as though no one else existed and they held each other's hand.</p><p>Rayner fought down a sharp, shard of jealousy at the way his husband seemed engrossed with the eerily alike woman. His mate's blue eyes then looked up and saw him and the mental caress he had sorely missed drove all unkind thoughts from his mind. He gave an incandescent smile and enthusiastic wave and he led the way towards the couple.</p><p>Tristam released his hold on the woman's hand as Rayner moulded tightly to his broad body, sighing his happiness.</p><p>"Tristam, I don't like it here." The woman's voice was husky and low, but the tone was that of a petulant child.</p><p>"I am Theophilus," the slender blond said, catching hold of the woman and pulling her towards the car. He knew Rayner needed a moment alone with his much missed mate. "I will take you to our car. It is quieter there."</p><p>He was surprised at the lack of enthusiasm from the blond woman, her attention rapt on Tristam and Rayner. He managed to get her inside the vehicle and got in beside her. The look of pure venom she gave him almost took the Dregan's breath away.</p><p>"You're not human and I don't like you," she hissed malevolently.</p><p>"No. I am not," Theophilus agreed. Then gave his own voice a brittle tone. "And I care not whether you like me."</p><p>The bald statement seemed to deflate the woman and she sat silently and sullenly. Theophilus felt guilty at his lack of empathy for the woman. She had been a prisoner, genetically altered ... and he inexplicably disliked her. He would do all he could to make her feel safe and secure, but his main priority was looking after his brothers. She would have many people to ensure she was well cared for soon enough. He glanced out at Tristam and Rayner as they ambled up to the vehicle, Tristam's arm possessively around Rayner's waist and each gazing lovingly at the other.</p><p>"Regina," Tristam said. "I want you to meet my husband Rayner and this is Theophilus who is as a brother to me."</p><p>Rayner smiled at the blond woman, but got a cold stare in response.</p><p>"I want to sit with you," she whined.</p><p>"You'll be fine with Theophilus," Tristam said.</p><p>"I don't like him. I don't like it here. I want to go home."</p><p>"You're coming to our home for a couple of days whilst you get used to being out in the world. We also want to make sure no one is going to come after you. Soon you'll have your choice of wherever you want to go," Tristam replied, his voice soft and soothing.</p><p>The atmosphere in the vehicle was so thick with tension it could have been cut with a knife. Regina insisted on petting Tristam constantly and smirked triumphantly at Rayner when the brunette turned hurt eyes at his mate who seemed oblivious to the touches. Theophilus simply wanted to slap her for the spoilt brat she seemed to be despite her apparent adulthood. He was also angry that Tristam seemed not to notice Rayner's growing discomfiture as his husband failed to stop Regina's touches.<br/></p>At the apartment, Regina liked Sholto no more than Rayner or Theophilus, but only gave them glaring looks when Tristam's attention was focused elsewhere. The three watched Tristam and Regina out on the small balcony. He held her hands and their heads angled together. They looked like two halves of a whole.Theophilus looked back at Rayner who looked lost and hurt. It was obvious to the Dregan that his brother needed comfort and love even more than the rescued woman and he gave a frown at Tristam who seemed too embroiled with her to realise Rayner was being neglected."I'll just get Regina settled in her room, love," Tristam smiled as the couple came inside the room.Theophilus gave a mental sigh of relief. Tristam needed to put distance between himself and his rescued prisoner. The blond hoped that Tristam was just being overly-protective and things would get back to normal quickly once their Papa took charge of Regina. He glanced at the direction they had taken. He still felt ill-at-ease about the woman. He wished his husband was home. He felt out of his depth to voice his concerns or how to approach the man who was both his leader and Protector if his behaviour continued in the same vein.****In their bed, Tristam caressed Rayner's face tenderly."Regina suffers from severe headaches from auditory overloading," he said. "Her eyesight fluctuates and hasn't taken well; I think that will fade to normal. Her sense of smell is well-developed...""Tristam, I don't want to discuss her in our bed," Rayner said, his eyes reflecting his hurt that even here there was no escaping her influence on his husband.For a moment Tristam stared at his husband, surprised by the outburst, and then he had the grace to blush."I'm sorry, angel," he whispered, his tone contrite. "She seems to push all my protective buttons. I remember what it was like to feel that everything was too close or too loud. But it's you I love, only ever you.""Show me," Rayner moaned, pressing his erection into Tristam's hip. "Need to feel you." He desperately craved the physical and mental intimacy to banish the feelings of insecurity. He whimpered softly as Tristam scented him, the bigger man starting at his jaw, then each armpit and finally pressing his nose into the dark nest of curls at Rayner's groin. He was eased onto his side and Tristam's tongue slid over his body, across his hip, bathing each cheek before they were parted, for the slick muscle to tease over tightly furled flesh. Rayner rocked back, soft mewling sounds spilling from his lips.Tristam rumbled his pleasure. He was surrounded by the sight, sound, feel, taste and scent of his mate and the gentle mental caress that ebbed and flowed effortlessly between them filled the cold, empty places Tristam had tried to ignore when separated from his beloved husband. He slid back up Rayner's body. He slipped one arm under the brunette's head and the other stroked Rayner's hard, damp flesh. His own erection pushed between smooth, warm thighs. Rayner's hand covered his as he stroked, feeling his lover's spiralling arousal."Love you, Tristam," Rayner moaned, his voice low and husky."Love you, angel," Tristam groaned. "Let it go, baby. Let me feel you come."Even as Tristam felt Rayner's shaft throb in prelude to its release, his own pulsed in sympathy. Both men came together, each softly calling the name of the other. Rayner finally sagging against his bigger mate as Tristam wrapped his arms protectively around the slender body.Rayner felt loved and safe and the intimacy of both mind and body dispelled the doubts that had plagued him. He pushed back as close as he could get to the broad, fur-dusted chest, inhaling the scent of warmth, love and completion."Love you," he murmured sleepily at the kiss to his temple."Love you, baby."The words registered dimly as Rayner's eyes closed, a smile of contentment on his lips.****Rayner awoke alone and the coolness of Tristam's side of the bed told him his lover had been gone awhile. He gave a sigh. He could understand Regina's need for someone who understood what she was going through and who could teach her how to bring wayward senses under control. He just wished she was not so antagonistic towards himself, Sholto and Theophilus. He knew Tristam would feel it necessary to be involved with her until satisfied she was coping, but her unfriendliness was making it almost impossible for him and the others to remain sympathetic towards her.After breakfast, Theophilus suggested they go across to the park. It was the blond's hope that the beauty and freedom would make Regina less clingy to Tristam, but he huffed his frustration to find she was no different outside to in. She seemed oblivious to the tranquil greenery or the sparkling blue lake, her eyes fixed on Tristam, fascinated with the man rather than nature. Theophilus, Rayner and Sholto sat on a very slowly revolving roundabout and Theophilus' heart ached to see his brother so saddened. Tristam seemed unconscious of his husband's need for attention. As Regina reluctantly left Tristam to make use of a rest facility, Theophilus waited a moment or two, took a deep breath and, leaving the other two, approached Tristam."I understand how protective you must feel towards Regina, Tristam," he said, carefully choosing his words. "But you have scarcely left her side since you returned here. Can you not see how much your husband needs you, too?" The furious look on Tristam's face took the Dregan by surprise, as did the tight grip to his forearm."Are you suggesting there is something between Regina and me?" Tristam growled, his nose flaring. "Perhaps it is I that should be concerned. You seem keen enough to 'comfort' Rayner."Even as the hurtful words fell from Tristam's lips, the bigger man regretted them. He knew he had been deliberately cruel and watched with a sickening sensation in his stomach as Theophilus turned away from him, shoulders slumping and body trembling. He knew Theophilus had mated for life with Xavier and had nothing but deep, abiding, brotherly love for Rayner. He reached out with a shaking hand, hoping to find the words to beg for the blond's forgiveness, but it was shoved aside by a small, solid and angry younger man."How dare you? How *dare* you?" Sholto growled furiously. It made no difference to Sholto that he was the smallest of the group. He fought to protect those he loved. He shoved Tristam hard enough for the bigger man to take a backward step. "You're supposed to be our Protector. We're supposed to feel safe enough with you to speak freely, about anything. If that's the way you behave then perhaps you're not suitable for that role. You *know* Theophilus loves us as brothers.""I...I didn't mean it. I don't know what made me so angry. I do know Theophilus' love is pure.""I'll keep Regina away," Sholto said, as he saw the woman watching the proceedings. She wore a smirk on her face and Sholto felt his hackles rise. "Sort it, Tristam," he growled, as he stalked away."Theophilus, please," Tristam said, tentatively touching a slim shoulder. "I'm sorry, so sorry. Forgive me, please?" He was glad the blond did not resist his attempts to turn him around, but the sight of the tears on sculptured cheeks had the bigger male's heart almost breaking. "I'm so sorry," he repeated, pulling the slender body into his arms. He scented Theophilus as he held him tight. There was just a lingering fear and distress. There was no challenge to him; no aggression, lust or arousal."I...I would n ...not..." Theophilus whispered brokenly, but was stopped by Tristam's shaking fingers on his lips. He glanced up at the bigger man and could see the genuine remorse in the normally clear blue eyes that were now darkened with pain."I know, beautiful. I know. I don't know what possessed me. I felt threatened, struck out and hurt one who didn't deserve my anger. Please forgive me, Theophilus?""You did hurt me, very much," Theophilus said, not wanting there to be anything hidden between him and Tristam. "But I know you. I know that outburst was not like you. I would not have our relationship fester because of it. I love Rayner and I love you. You're my brothers, my family. Of course I forgive you."At Theophilus' words, Tristam crushed him to his chest, burying his face in the long blond hair and inhaling deeply. Now he could scent Theophilus' normal sweetness and he felt an inexplicable unease lift from him."Tristam, Theophilus, is everything ok?" Rayner's anxious voice had Tristam release the blond to gaze at his husband."It is nothing," Theophilus assured. "All is well.""It was not *nothing*," Tristam said honestly. "Theophilus spoke openly to me and I was hurtful in return.""And I have forgiven you and it is over," the blond nodded emphatically. He kissed Tristam softly on the cheek and repeated the action with Rayner. "I will join Sholto and we will take Regina home. Spend some time together. Take a boat to the little island out there, enjoy one another," he smiled as he walked away.Tristam hugged Rayner tight as he watched the retreating figure and gave a mental prayer of thanks that Theophilus was naturally compassionate and forgiving."Are you ok?" Rayner asked, picking up on the lingering mental distress of his mate."I'm sorry, love," the bigger man said in response. "I was neglecting you and I don't know what it is about Regina that makes me become so wrapped up in her. I don't remember anything of my time as a prisoner in the labs. Jameson thinks I purposely blocked it because it was painful and unhappy. I just want to show Regina that once they're controlled, she can enjoy her senses. I needed Jameson and Aurora and although it was difficult, I wouldn't be without my enhancements now. They're a part of me and make me who I am. But nothing should make me ignore you, nor make me hurt one whose only crime was to point out you needed me.""I love you, Tristam," Rayner said, entwining his arms around his husband's neck. He felt the bigger man nuzzle into him and hugged him tightly."Let's do as Theophilus suggested," Tristam smiled as they broke apart. "Just you and me on the lake's little island."Rayner grinned and nodded enthusiastically.****The two men spent an idyllic afternoon. They visited the island where they lay together, touching, kissing, letting themselves enjoy the simple pleasures of gentle intimacy and the beauty around them. The time flew past and it was getting dark as they returned to their apartment. They gasped at the sight of Sholto nursing a bruised cheek and swollen eye."What happened?" Tristam demanded. "Are Theophilus and Regina ok?""Regina did this," Sholto said angrily.Close up, the two men could see the signs that Sholto had been suffering from his pregnancy sickness in addition to the spectacular bruising."What do you mean?" Tristam asked. "Was it an accident?""No. It was deliberate. And if it hadn't been for Theophilus' speed, even in his condition, she would have kicked me despite knowing I was carrying.""I don't understand," Tristam shook his head disbelievingly, yet the evidence was before him."I felt sick when we got home. When I came back into the room, I heard Theophilus explaining he and I, as well as Rayner, were pregnant. She got angry when she realised you weren't following right behind us and angrier as the time went on. Theophilus went to the kitchen to make us some drinks and I thought Regina was following him. She stood up as I got to my feet and lashed out at me. She packs a solid punch and I dropped to my knees. She was readying herself to kick me when Theophilus flew back in. He all but threw her into her room, but didn't dare leave her alone."Rayner gave a reassuring hug to the red-head as Sholto's shoulders slumped."I've been of little use to Theophilus. There's a strange smell in the apartment that keeps making me feel ill and so he's had to stay in Regina's room alone. I know he's exhausted, because I keep checking on him, but I can't take his place to let him rest.""Tristam, you have to do something," Rayner said desperately. "We need to get her to Papa and let others care for her.""Let me relieve Theophilus. You contact Jameson, see what can be done," Tristam said. He emerged a moment later, almost carrying the exhausted Dregan. Sholto was right about the smell in the apartment; it seemed more noticeable in Regina's bedroom, although the sobbing woman was apparently oblivious thanks to her crying.Rayner and Sholto immediately began fussing over the blond as Tristam went back into Regina's room. Rayner glanced up briefly at the sounds of hysterical sobbing. He sighed, hoping the woman's apparent vulnerability would not sway Tristam's resolve. As Sholto cared for Theophilus, Rayner tried to contact Jameson, but his Papa's private line was constantly engaged and he did not dare use a more public line. He was sure that the morning would be time enough to deal with getting rid of Regina. Sholto and Theophilus were tired and needed rest."Are you well, my brother?" Theophilus asked, concerned by Rayner's quiet contemplation."I can't get hold of Papa. We'll need to try again in the morning. I was just wondering if perhaps Regina suffers from some kind of psychological reaction to her senses. Tristam's reactions were always physical, but he doesn't remember if there were any others in the lab.""Perhaps even a hormonal problem," Sholto offered."Whatever it is, I suppose we should be grateful that she doesn't react badly to Tristam. He would have had incredible difficulties rescuing her if she'd reacted to him as she does to us," Rayner added. "Let's get some rest. Listening to Regina, Tristam isn't going to be leaving her alone anytime soon."The three men busied themselves looking after each other and the sleeping arrangements, finally settling on all three sharing the large bed in the second master bedroom. Rayner arranged a plate of food each for Tristam and Regina which he advised his husband would be in the kitchen. He took snacks and drinks for himself, Sholto and Theophilus; for once purposely pandering to their more unhealthy cravings. Pushing any unkind thoughts about Regina from his mind, he focused on enjoying the company of his friends, his hand occasionally brushing where his growing child lay.****Tristam was aware that it was daylight and gave a soft moan of appreciation at the tiny, soft kisses that were scattered across his face and the knowing hand that kneaded at his groin."Don't open your eyes," was husked in his ear. Smiling he breathed in the sweet scent of his aroused mate. It seemed subtly different, but Rayner's hormones were shifting daily, altering the scent he knew and loved. He was straddled and he gave a slight frown as a part of him felt *something* was amiss. The body astride him rocked into his erection, but it felt...wrong. He reached out to caress his mate's mind, to assure himself all was well with Rayner and encountered only a wall of mental anguish.His eyes flew open, just as Regina's lips possessed his. For a moment he was frozen in shock and then he shoved the startled woman roughly from his lap. His mind sought out his mate. But was it was refused the refuge it sought. With a cry of Rayner's name he staggered from Regina's room, but found the door to the apartment open and knew instinctively the other men had gone. He flew down the stairs, hoping to catch his mate, but as he emerged into the garage, their vehicle was already pulling away, his hearing picking up on the anguished sobbing from his distraught husband. Unable to make sense of what had happened, Tristam returned to the apartment. Regina appeared, looking warily at him."Tristam?" Her hand reached to him, but fell at the shake of Tristam's head and the raised hand that warned her not to come closer."I don't know what happened, Regina," he said carefully. "I genuinely thought I was with my husband. I have no desire for you. I'm sorry, Regina. Please, please just go to your room. I need to get things sorted." He ignored the sob that preceded the woman running into her room. His real concern was reaching Rayner.He tried twice to get through to Jameson, his temper fraying further with each unsuccessful attempt. Before he could try a third time, the machine showed an incoming call. The image was not displayed, nor was the caller's number and the voice was mechanical. It spoke Dregan, a language almost unspoken off its homeworld. The instructions were terse and to the point. 'Stay. Make no calls. Ten minutes. Be ready.'Tristam's eyes flicked to the room in which Regina still sobbed. As unhappy as he was he had hurt the woman he had rescued, his greater concern was the hurt to his husband. He had no way to explain his behaviour to his mate and wondered just how he could ever earn Rayner's forgiveness and regain his trust.****Tristam had recognised the heartbeat and scent of Uist before the cat-man entered the apartment. He stared silently at the other man. Uist's demeanour was that of a warrior ready for battle. His body fur was thickened and his claws were extended. His amber eyes flicked briefly at Tristam as he tilted his head. Tristam nodded and took his place at Uist's side at the door to Regina's room. As surprised as he had been by Uist's behaviour, he was stunned by Regina's.As they opened her door, she barrelled out, striking at the cat-man. She kicked, screamed and tried to gouge, but as a trained fighter, Uist had little trouble subduing her."Regina, please don't struggle. Uist won't hurt you if you don't struggle.""Don't let him take me, please don't let him take me," she begged."You drive," Uist said curtly. "Home."Tristam had no need to ask the destination. Only one place on Earth was called home and that was the house where he and Rayner had grown up. He noted the increased security as he drove through the electric gates. Personnel, human and otherwise, patrolled the grounds and his ears picked up the unmistakable sounds of electronic surveillance devices. They had been here just a couple of days ago and none of this security had been in place then. Work must have gone on round the clock for it to be so well organised.As they entered the house, Aurora stood just inside. She gave Tristam a sympathetic smile."Bedroom," she said softly.The big man took off at a run. There was only one room she could be referring to; the bedroom he and Rayner had shared as children. He hesitated outside the room, his body trembling. He tapped nervously on the door and entered slowly. He stood, not extending his senses or his mind, waiting for Rayner to make the decision as to whether it was acceptable for him to approach. He released a sob he had not realised was building as Rayner simply opened his arms.Tristam refused to rush. He moved swiftly to the bed, but then slowed his movements to allow his young husband to change his mind if so desired. Instead he was almost pulled to Rayner's chest, the brunette throwing apart his shirt so Tristam could be skin-to-skin. The bigger man whimpered softly, pleadingly as he buried his face into Rayner's neck, covering the lithe body with his own. He felt the loving mental caress and wept into Rayner's shoulder as love washed over him.Rayner knew there would be no need for words. He felt his husband holding back, waiting for acceptance and let all his love for Tristam flow into the link they shared. He carded his hand through Tristam's hair and rubbed tense shoulders as the bigger man sobbed silently."It's ok, love," Rayner whispered. "It wasn't your fault. We've all been deceived.""I don't understand," Tristam husked."It was a set-up. Regina wasn't a prisoner. It was all conceived to bring you and her together. We weren't meant to access the space station. That's why the rescue was easy and Xavier and Uist ran into difficulties. But if they hadn't..."<br/>"What was her agenda?" Tristam asked."We don't know."The two men shifted their positions until Tristam lay between Rayner's spread thighs, cradled against the warmth of his mate's pelvis. Slowly their lips met and their tongues slid together, tasting and loving. For long minutes they kissed and caressed mentally and physically until Tristam felt composed enough to face the woman who had tried to come between him and his husband."Let's go, angel," Tristam said decisively. "I want her out of our home as quickly as possible. I can't believe I was so easily manipulated.""Don't blame yourself, lover," Rayner murmured, caressing the rugged face with soft hands. "She was designed to appeal to you. Uist wouldn't say much until we got you here. It's why we couldn't contact Papa. He had Elite watching us whilst he secured our home." Rayner nestled against the bigger body as they hesitated at the door. "I'm scared, Tristam. I've never seen Papa so worried, or Uist so agitated."Tristam kissed his love tenderly."I will not be such a fool or let you, our unborn or our family, down so badly a second time," he vowed.They moved as one into the large living room to a smile and nod from Aurora. Tristam knew it was something of unique importance when his Mama did not retire from the room. She simply slid away from the main group to watch and listen well away from what he now considered the danger: Regina. He could see her almost vibrating with anger and giving venomous looks to Uist, Sholto and Theophilus.The cat-man was as angry as Tristam had ever seen, his fur rippling and claws remaining unsheathed as he stood protectively by the other pregnant men. Tristam could sympathise with him. At the moment, he wanted to tear Regina apart himself."We need to talk, Regina," he said curtly. He was through treating her gently. It was all an act."Tristam, I need you."The voice was Rayner's although spoken by Regina and Tristam could also recognise the almost perfect imitation of the scent of his mate's arousal emanating from the woman. His fury spiked; that was why he had felt so comfortable with her, so protective of her. She looked like him and had somehow been engineered to be able to mimic others' voices and scents."I don't know whether your real name is even Regina," Tristam growled menacingly. "But the deception is over. What was your intention here? Why target me and my family?""You're mine," Regina howled. "I was made for you." She turned eyes that glinted with madness on Theophilus. "Your fault. All your fault." Without further warning she lunged at the Dregan, but Uist moved faster.In a blur of graceful motion, one hand pulled Theophilus to safety behind his own body and the other balled into a fist that slammed unceremoniously into Regina's chin. The force lifted the woman off the floor, rendering her unconscious instantly. He stood over the fallen body as if willing her to stand and try again. He glanced back at Sholto and Theophilus who held each other tightly and growled before stepping back and enveloping both in a protective embrace."I'll have her admitted to one of our secure medical facilities," Jameson said. "It's clear we won't get an answer from her easily. We can't even be sure whether what we just witnessed was an act or a consequence of her innate mental instability.""She is unstable?" Theophilus asked."From what Xavier was able to gather, yes, son," Jameson said sadly. "Go into my den, boys. Aurora will make us some drinks whilst I have Regina taken away. Xavier is on his way here and he can debrief us all."****It did not take long for Xavier to arrive and join his family. Everyone waited patiently as he and Theophilus spent long minutes holding and kissing before the reptilian was finally happy to let his young mate go. He watched as Theophilus took his place to sit at Uist's side, the cat-man replacing his arm around the blond as Sholto nestled at his other side. He took in Rayner sitting cradled in Tristam's lap and the way the young human was constantly scented and nuzzled."I apologise for taking so long, my family," he said. "Much of what we found was encrypted and took longer to decipher that was envisioned." He looked at Tristam and Rayner. "I am especially sorry i did not find out Regina's true nature sooner to prevent what happened, Tristam.""You carry no guilt, Xavier," Tristam assured. "I know you will have worked as quickly as possible.""Regina has only been altered in the last year. Not only genetically for her senses, but she underwent extensive cosmetic surgery to appear physically similar to you. It seems our adversary was uncertain what look to go with.""I do not understand," Theophilus spoke up. "What look?""Unless Regina enlightens us, we will not know whether her manipulators, or she, chose to look like Tristam. There were also computer graphics of a female Rayner, Sholto and Theophilus. It may have been decided that a female who looked like Tristam was less suspicious than one who looked like Rayner or our husbands," he added looking at Uist, giving a rolling motion of his shoulders in imitation of a shrug."Tristam was the target, although we cannot be certain for what reason. We do not know what our adversary had as their ultimate intention. What is worrying is they knew that Tristam has, to some degree, an enhanced sense of smell. They were uncertain of how enhanced, however. But even so, that is not public knowledge.""He may even be one of those responsible for my enhancements," Tristam murmured."Maybe, my brother," Xavier nodded. "But if so, he did not do such a good job with Regina. He has used a form genetic manipulation which is clearly unstable and looks as though it will quickly break down. I cannot say what the long-term prognosis is for her, but her enhancements will soon cease to exist. That, at least, is one blessing for Regina.""I have contacted Uist's sire and Xavier's parents, asking them to come and visit," Jameson spoke up. "Sholto should contact some of his more unconventional and more distantly dispersed friends because we need as many eyes and ears unobtrusively looking for this enemy as possible. The only places I will consider you all safe is here and aboard 'Silver'."The group remained silent as they digested the information. The news could hardly have come at a worse time for them. Three were particularly vulnerable and would only become more so in the coming months. Their nemesis was knowledgeable but they had no idea who it was or what he wanted. Their only current hope was a mentally unstable woman. It made a grim picture.****Rayner insisted on taking Tristam to bed early. He could still feel his mate's guilt over being manipulated and wanted to put an end to it. He stripped his mate slowly, pushing the bigger man to lie on their bed before denuding himself more slowly. He gave a mental smile at the sight of Tristam's manhood filling and rising in appreciation. He pushed the powerful legs apart and knelt between them, bending to capture Tristam's lips and let their tongues dance slowly."I love you." Rayner's eyes were un-shadowed, clear and bright like the stars that sparkled in the heavens that they so often travelled through.Tristam leaned up for another kiss, stunned by the trust this man gave him so freely. He smiled at the beauty in his arms."I love you, too, Rayner," he husked.Tristam willingly accepted the confident touches. Rayner was a diligent lover and soon Tristam was panting with need. His mate was now focused on Tristam's shaft and the blond groaned under the oral assault of gentle nips and tender licks. His weeping slit was laved with a loving tongue before a tormenting mouth descended slowly over his iron-hard flesh, Rayner's tongue continued to dart around the flared head and he could feel the brunette swallowing his copious pre-come. Tristam forced his hips to move only minutely, resisting the urge to bury himself in the warm, wet, cavern.Rayner was only able to take half of his mate's magnificent manhood before his gag reflex set in and he had to back off. He could tell Tristam was being very careful not to thrust. Rayner played carefully with his husband's sac, rolling the precious orbs as his mouth continued to suck and pleasure.Tristam could feel his balls draw up in imminent release. His young lover also recognised the signs and he sped up his slides down the pulsing flesh, his tongue flicking over the sensitive slit. Tristam let go all control and thrust just once before coming in a flood of salty-sweet fluid. He moaned as Rayner drank all he could offer, using a hand to milk him, and then lapped at the twitching organ that seemed to have barely softened. The blond pulled him up into his arms and kissed him hard and deep. His tongue thrust greedily into Rayner's mouth tasting himself everywhere and feeling the barely banked ashes of love, lust and desire begin to blaze anew."That was perfect, angel. What would you like from me, Rayner?" Tristam's voice was low and husky and the bigger man felt his mate tremble in arousal and anticipationRayner wriggled impossibly closer, locking scorching sienna with smouldering sapphire as their eyes met. He closed a hand around the far from satiated flesh of his husband."This, inside me, loving me. I want to watch you as you enter me. I want to see you giving and receiving pleasure with me."Tristam twitched in response to the graphic request. He smiled rolling them over and parting Rayner's legs with one of his."Hand me a pillow," he husked. Tristam knelt between Rayner's legs, pulling him forward until his mate's slender hips were off the bed and draped over his thighs. He placed the pillow under Rayner's buttocks and reached into the bedside table for oil.Rayner watched in breathless anticipation while Tristam poured a golden stream over both their shafts and his hands. Then his husband began to stroke Rayner's aching flesh with one hand while the fingers of the other gently breached his tiny, puckered opening. First one, then two and finally three completed the tender stretching. Rayner writhed and moaned his hands clutching at the bedding. He felt Tristam remove his fingers and shift Rayner's body until the tip of the blond's solid arousal nudged his small opening and Tristam's hands went to his narrow hips. Rayner slid his hands over Tristam's and whispered;"Now. You in me. Please.""I love you so much, angel," Tristam said, letting his sincerity, love and desire flow into Rayner's mind. Tristam slid inside his mate's body. Tight heat pulled him in deeper, grasping tightly to him. Only when Rayner was completely impaled on his flesh did he stop and leant forward to kiss the moaning man beneath him.Their tongues mated. Rayner's hands moved and gripped Tristam's shoulders, while his husband began to thrust in and out. Their tempo quickened, Rayner wrapping his legs around Tristam's waist and using them to pull him in deeper still. When Tristam adjusted his angle to hit his pleasure spot, Rayner began to spasm and cry aloud his husband's name and when his mate began to stroke him in time to his thrusts, Rayner exploded with a howl.Three more thrusts and Tristam let go his own control, releasing his seed into the heated depths of the man he loved. He collapsed to the side watching Rayner's heaving chest as he rested his head on a sweat-damp shoulder. Rayner's arms reached to hold him tightly and his soft voice sounded in his ear."I'm never letting go and I'm never leaving you." Rayner nipped his ear. "I love you.""I love you, angel, so very much." Tristam smiled into the dark hair. The blond did not remember his eyes closing as Rayner continued to pet his thoroughly sated body.****It had been almost a week since Regina had been placed in a secure medical facility. There had been no success in finding out anything from her. Regina seemed to have locked herself permanently in the time just prior to her 'rescue', telling everyone that Tristam would be coming for her soon.The team had remained in the house and at that moment Uist, Sholto, Rayner and Tristam were resting in Jameson's den whilst Theophilus and Xavier took advantage of the indoor pool that the older human had installed as a necessity on knowing three of his boys were pregnant.Theophilus leant against a tiled wall, his lower half beneath the water, stroking himself slowly at his husband's command. Xavier was standing by his side and he knew his mate was watching intently as the younger man writhed in the water. Eyes now closed, head tilted back, his hand out of sight, Theophilus moaned breathlessly, incredibly aroused remembering the look in Xavier's unblinking eyes.Ducking under the water, the lizard watched Theophilus stroke his shaft with one hand while the other, still above water, plucked at his nipples. With one powerful kick, Xavier swam between the spread legs. He pulled away the slender hand, enveloping his lover's erection with infinite care mindful of his maw of sharp teeth. Even through the water, he heard the cry and then felt the two hands that instantly began caressing his frill. He easily took the hard flesh all the way in wrapping his tongue around his mate's arousal. With his snout buried in the silken curls of Theophilus' groin, he started a gentle motion that brought renewed groans from the man above him. Almost immediately he coaxed Theophilus to release his intoxicating elixir down his throat. Releasing the softening organ, he rose to the surface and saw the dazed, golden gaze of his lover. Theophilus promptly reached for him and pulled him in for a kiss. Xavier's tongue flicked in and out of the mammal's mouth, sharing Theophilus' taste with his lover. Theophilus always tasted of home to the reptilian."Oh, Xavier, I love you. I love you so much, my husband." Theophilus broke away to breathe and whispered his heart-felt declaration.The voice had a soft, breathy quality that had Xavier trilling low and deep. He brushed dripping hair from his husband's face and smiled at him."I love you, too, beloved."Theophilus slid his hands slowly up the arms that held him to the back of Xavier' neck under the frill, pulling him closer."Please," he whispered, his need shining out of the glistening golden eyes. His husband's fingers slid beneath the water and teased at his entrance. Theophilus smiled in delight before throwing back his head at the sensation of Xavier' fingers sliding into his body. Xavier mouthed down the long neck with consummate tenderness until he reached the hollow at the base of his throat. He felt the shivers when he rasped his tongue across sensitive skin."Xavier!" Theophilus writhed in his arms, his re-hardening shaft rubbed against the reptilian's stomach and his legs wrapped around the lizard's waist. He felt his husband's tail wrap around him, under his buttocks, helping keep him in place.Xavier shifted him higher and replaced his fingers with his unsheathed sexes and hissed in pleasure as he slid into the blood-hot channel. Waiting, he listened to the heartbeat that mattered more than his own. He had never felt this connected before to anyone in his long life. Theophilus' hands soothed out tension in his shoulders he had not realised was there. Every flex or twitch of muscle within the familiar body seemed to echo in his own. He could feel Theophilus' need and it fed his already blazing desire. He could no longer wait. Xavier held onto the slim body and began a long glide out before thrusting back into the tight sheath, hitting that hidden spot within Theophilus that made him moan and writhe with need. Xavier sped up his thrusts, wanting to drive Theophilus into incoherency and oblivion.Theophilus held on to the broad shoulders. The buoyancy of the water meant he did not have anything to push back against. Instead he opted for muscles contractions that fired Xavier's blood. His husband's low trill reverberated throughout Theophilus' body, driving him to his zenith. The colder air around his upper body acted was a contrast to the white-hot burn in his channel as Xavier plunged in and out.Xavier scattered licking kisses over the warm, silky skin of his beautiful young mate who made sweet mewling sounds of delight."Love you," Theophilus sighed on a whisper and wrapped his legs tighter around Xavier' waist."And I you, my heart."Xavier cupped the firm, white buttocks in his hands and tilted Theophilus to the perfect angle before beginning a series of rapid thrusts that had his husband moaning in ecstasy. Then his formed his knot and neither of them could last any longer, releasing their mutual pleasure and crying joyously. Xavier kept Theophilus from sliding bonelessly into the water. His blond head was a welcome weight on the reptilian's shoulder. He pressed his lips to his husband's temple, nuzzling gently.Theophilus stretched from head to toes, moving sensuously against Xavier' skin. Raising his head, he looked at Xavier with so much love in his eyes that the reptilian could feel it radiating out, searing him with its heat and bonding them even closer."I love you," Theophilus whispered nestling against the lizard that held him so safely."I love you, my heart," Xavier replied. He carried his exhausted mate to a nest covered with thick, soft towels. They would rejoin the rest of their family once Theophilus had slept for a while. Covering his mate with a couple of the towels, he settled alongside the already sleeping blond.****The rest of the day passed comfortably but the six looked up, instantly on the alert, when Jameson came in, his face bearing a mix of anger, disbelief and worry."I've just been told of a breach of security," he said tersely."Regina," said Tristam, surging to his feet to be flanked by Uist. "She's escaped?""She's dead," Jameson said. He looked at his family one by one. "She was escorted to a bathroom, where she was going to be bathed. The water was not in the bath and can only be run by using a code. I've seen the video. The carer received a call and went outside. Then the door opened and, as another figure entered, the screen distorted. An emergency was sounded almost immediately. The carer was found unconscious outside the bathroom. When the screen cleared, just a few seconds before security arrived, Regina was already face down in an inch of water.""Then our adversary is ruthless," Uist said. "If he knew where she was and could get to her, he knew she was no threat to him.""Her mind was unravelling daily," Xavier said sadly. "She would never have revealed anything.""He may be unknown as yet, but I intend to invoke Bloodfeud," Uist said. "I cannot, will not, allow any to threaten us now," as he spoke his eyes flicked over each of the pregnant men he loved and protected."As much as I would like to know his motives, I cannot disagree with Uist's decision," Tristam said. "I would not want to take the chance he could harm any of our husbands in their delicate states. Their safety *must* come first.""Willis has already been contacting his extended Pride. I think he mentioned his own sibling and his offspring?""Denys," Uist nodded. "He is a warrior as is his older son Jaymz and Dayd, the younger, is a physician. My sire will probably want to be a part of the search for our enemy and yet ensure protection comes from the Pride.""I am ensuring Darius and his team are part of the security based here as often as possible," Jameson added. "I believe some of your friends are heading here?" The older human looked over at Sholto."There will be some arriving in the next few weeks. They're looking to conduct some enquiries before getting here.""I'm sorry, boys. My own Elite investigations are currently drawing blanks, but I have some more covert enquiries I hope will be more fruitful."<br/>"We will conduct our own from here and 'Silver'," Tristam said. "We can go through everything via the ship's AI. We will find this threat."****As night fell, Xavier and Theophilus were readying themselves to sleep. Neither male was dressed and so at the gentle tap to their door, Theophilus sat amongst the cushions, carefully shielding himself as Xavier checked who it was. He gave a smile, inviting Uist and Sholto into the room. The cat-man wore sleep pants and Sholto an oversized t-shirt. Sholto looked exhausted, but his stomach had become unsettled and they had retired earlier than the other two couples."We cannot rest," Uist growled.Theophilus had risen instantly and drew Sholto into a hug. He felt the auburn-haired human snuffle at his neck. Smiling, he urged Sholto into the nest to lie alongside him. His smile widened as the smaller man curled on his side, burying his face against Theophilus' shoulder and fell asleep almost instantly. Sholto had always settled quickly when able to breathe the natural, sweet scent of the blond."Sholto is fine here, my brother," Theophilus whispered. "Do you wish to sleep here, too?"Before Uist could reply, there was a second tap and no one in the room was surprised to find Rayner and Tristam outside.As Tristam, Uist and Xavier murmured quietly amongst themselves, Rayner simply joined Theophilus and Sholto, taking his place at Theophilus' other side. He, too, had been unsettled for a while, the stress of the day taking its toll. He just wanted to be as close to his husband and brothers as possible and had been sure Uist and Sholto would be thinking the same. He gave a wordless sound of thanks as Theophilus' arm encircled him and he mimicked Sholto's position, both humans' hands entwining over the gentle swell of Theophilus' stomach.Theophilus decided to let the others make their own decisions about where they slept. He was content to look after Sholto and Rayner and was sleeping just seconds after the brunette.Xavier smiled at the three sleepers as Uist and Tristam argued quietly about taking shifts on guard duty. He gently squeezed their shoulders to get their attention."Join your husbands and sleep well, my brothers," the reptilian smiled. "I can remain awake without difficulty through the night and rest with my beloved tomorrow. Go," he added as the two men hesitated, yet looked longingly at where those they loved slept. Xavier watched as Uist and Tristam curled around their husbands, the bigger men's hands coming to rest over the entwined hands of Rayner and Sholto. Nodding his approval, the lizard moved to place himself between his family and the door, taking a weapon and his laptop. He knew the house was well-protected, but it made him feel better.It was going to be hard on all of them until the new threat was eliminated.

<p><b>Silver 7 Beauty and the Beast</b></p><p><br/>The lithe body moved as sleek as a seal through the water, blond hair restrained in a loose plait. Swimming was excellent exercise for an expectant father, ensuring Theophilus kept supple and stretched without overexerting himself. It was not as though he could purposely exhaust himself. An attentive husband kept a close watch over his pregnant mate, as did the rest of his family. These few months would be the most physically tiring as the baby he carried grew rapidly. Theophilus rolled onto his back and floated, caressing the swell of his belly and smiling.</p><p>Sometimes he could scarcely believe he carried a child conceived from the love he shared with his reptilian mate. His life could have been so different. He pushed the darker thoughts away, focusing on the love he knew Xavier had for him. As unexpected as this gift was, it was one that brought joy to both males, as well as Theophilus' extended and diverse family. He could not suppress his giggle of happiness. He was in the last third of his pregnancy, Sholto was approaching mid-term and Rayner was just a few weeks behind him. Theophilus looked forward to all three births eagerly, although he knew his would be the most difficult.</p><p>He gave a squeal and giggle and strong teeth nibbled along the underside of his legs to nip carefully at his buttocks and then he was in Xavier's strong arms, laughing as his mate lifted him clear of the shallow water. He rubbed his face affectionately against the beloved reptilian visage.</p><p>"Beautiful," Xavier murmured as he carried his mate securely against his chest. Pregnancy had been difficult for the blond, but Theophilus had never complained, too enraptured with the thought of carrying their child to be anything less than happy. At the moment, relaxed and well rested, the blond positively glowed. Xavier's carefully created supplements had eliminated Theophilus' early nausea and now helped counteract the exhaustion that would be prevalent.</p><p>The group had taken a break from any active missions whilst the pregnancies ran their course and whilst their unknown enemy remained at large. As such, Xavier's main work in the lab was finding the best combinations of supplements for the younger men. Sholto was still suffering from pregnancy sickness, whereas Rayner was simply tired. The big lizard was happy to devote his time and skills to make the three pregnancies as easy as possible for his brethren. In between, he spent as much time as he could with Theophilus.</p><p>Theophilus wriggled alluringly as Xavier teased his tiny opening with his tail. He carefully laid his precious bundle on a comfortable nest of cushions and pillows topped with big thick towels. Soon it would be too uncomfortable to join with his mate when they made love and the reptilian intended for them to enjoy intimacy as often as possible whilst they still could. He guided Theophilus' smooth legs around his bulk, his hands caressing the delicate swell of his husband's abdomen and his tail probing insistently until Theophilus entrance acceded to the erotic demands and flowered open. As his tail slid into the hot, tight sheath, Xavier gyrated it carefully to caress his mate's hidden jewel.</p><p>Theophilus moaned his appreciation as one of Xavier's hands stroked him whilst his tail worked inside him. He gave a soft, impassioned cry of Xavier's name, holding Xavier's head to his breast, as the forked tongue slid around a sensitive, rose-pink nipple, squeezing with care and flicking seductively over the taut nub. He spread his legs further, arching his back. He writhed and mewled, his hair coming free from its plait to flow like golden silk around him.</p><p>"Please, my husband," he pleaded softly. "Please."</p><p>Xavier honoured the request, unsheathing his hemipenes and sliding them into Theophilus blood-hot channel to a low purr of appreciation from the blond. He felt the long limbs tighten around him as his lover tried to take him deeper.</p><p>"Gentle, my heart," he chided gently, his tongue slipping into his mate's mouth to a muted mewl from the younger man. "I will love you as you desire, but let me do all the work."</p><p>"I love you so much, Xavier," Theophilus whimpered quietly. "I need you."</p><p>"I am here, beloved and I will take care of you as you wish." He formed his knot, letting his shimmering sexes rub against his mate's sweet spot. His tail rippled from root to tip over Theophilus' engorged shaft, one hand sensually tormented the over-sensitive breasts and his tongue thrust rhythmically into the blond's softly panting mouth.</p><p>Theophilus was caught up in the amatory assault. He felt as though his husband was making love to his entire body and the flames of desire, carefully built up by the reptilian, were now scorching unchecked through every cell and synapse of Theophilus' body. He moaned wantonly, trying to convey his pleasure, trusting his mate would understand. As much as he wanted to keep watching the adored face of his husband, the golden eyes fluttered closed as supernovae began to detonate before his eyes. His musical cry of Xavier's name was harmonised with a low trill of pleasure from his reptilian mate and, as his seed arced from his shaft, he felt liquid heat filling him.</p><p>As his orgasm finally ended, Theophilus' body slumped replete. He opened heavy-lidded, satiated orbs to watch his husband lick him clean. The long, agile organ laved his chest, carefully lapped at his sated sex and tenderly cleansed his hidden entrance. As much as he wanted to reciprocate, his body seemed too heavy. A leaden hand reached his lover's head, stroking tiredly at the aural depression it could reach and petting desultorily at the lilac frill.</p><p>Giving his unique smile, Xavier arranged their bodies until his mate was cradled comfortably against his chest, his tail stroking Theophilus' thighs, as his hand rested over the small swell of his belly.</p><p>"I tire so quickly, even with your help, my husband," Theophilus whispered. He let his body relax against his mate's bulk and nestled comfortably in the protective embrace.</p><p>"Your body takes care of the child growing within, beloved," Xavier replied, his hand rubbing over Theophilus' warm skin. "You need more rest whilst he grows."</p><p>"Am I a burden to you and our family?" Theophilus asked anxiously.</p><p>"Never," Xavier assured. "You take good care of Sholto and Rayner. Your presence settles Sholto almost as well as anything I can produce. You carry a precious gift within you and it will not be long before Sholto and Rayner tire as quickly as you do as their babies grow. You, at least, have been spared the sickness that plagues Sholto."</p><p>The couple spared a thought for the auburn-haired human and his PrideHomer husband. They had gone to spend a couple of days on PrideHome with Uist's sire and sibling. It had been under strict secrecy, the couple in disguise and under assumed names. It was likely to be the last off world visit any of the couples made until after the birthing. Theophilus and Xavier waited aboard 'Silver' for the rendezvous with the returning couple, a couple of Elite ships in near proximity, and then all would return to Jameson's home and Rayner and Tristam. A soft smile played around the blond's lips as he slipped into satiated slumber. He had missed his brothers and was looking forward to them all being together once more.</p><p>****</p><p>Uist's head rose slowly. He had been awake for a few minutes, using his senses of scent and hearing to ascertain if anyone else was in the room. He detected nothing except a septic aroma that irritated his sensitive nose. His mate was not there. He was alone.</p><p>Naked.</p><p>And secured at ankles and wrists to a cold, smooth wall.</p><p>His arms were raised as high above his head as they could be. His ankles were held by metal bands that kept his legs spread wide apart. His genitals had been pulled from their protective pouch and he could feel they had been as scrupulously cleansed as the rest of his body. He knew he had been given an enema and the thought of unseen, unfelt hands touching him so intimately had his rage simmering. He assumed the vulnerable pose was intended to magnify his helplessness. He could be touched at will by his captors but, instead of increasing his vulnerability, it increased his rage. However, as a seasoned Warrior, he kept his face schooled into impassivity.</p><p>Across the room was a small cot bolted to the floor. It had a metal rail around it which had a long chain ending in a single manacle attached. A screen encircled a chemical toilet, which Uist could scent along with antibacterial hand wash. His eyes flitted around the rest of what was little more than a windowless, grey box. He spotted the small camera, its green eye glowing balefully. He assumed the room would be wired for sound as well as vision and let all his rage and hate centre on the green light.</p><p>"I'm glad to see you awake, Uist," a disembodied voice came from the direction of the camera. "As you can see, you are unhurt and have been cleaned and tended by my medical staff. Unfortunately, your mate's pregnancy meant he was more sensitive to the gas we used to drug all aboard your vessel. He will be joining you soon. We wanted to ensure he had recovered from his nausea, and associated difficulties, before bringing him here."</p><p>"If harm befalls my mate or my unborn there will be no safe place in this universe for you to hide," Uist snarled.</p><p>"I assure you, Uist, it is not my intention to harm you, Sholto or his baby. So long as you both co-operate neither of you will be hurt. Attempt to escape and you will be punished. You will bear punishment for anything Sholto tries and equally, he will be punished if you try anything. Sholto will be brought to you in a few moments."</p><p>Uist growled dangerously. He could not purposely endanger his mate and unborn. However, if he got just one, safe opportunity to deal with their kidnapper...He gave another low snarl of fury as Sholto was escorted into the room. His mate was also naked and looked pale and dishevelled, the lingering sent of pregnancy sickness still assailed Uist's nostrils. At the cat-man's instinctive sound, Sholto raised his head.</p><p>The guard stared openly at the attractive young male, a hand going to Sholto's shoulder, preventing him from going to his restrained mate. His eyes flicked briefly over to Uist at the feral snarl in response to his unwelcome touch. However, it was the angry voice from the camera that had his hand snatched quickly away.</p><p>"You were ordered to keep your hands off him. Sholto, you may have a few moments with your husband."</p><p>The younger man did not hesitate, moulding his body against the solid bulk of his mate and soaking up the warmth and scent. He felt Uist rubbing his scent glands against him, knowing the PrideHomer would be trying to replace the stench of unknown hands on him with his own unique scent. He breathed deeply, letting the familiar and beloved scent calm his still-churning stomach and frayed nerves.</p><p>Uist could smell sickness, fear and others on his mate. He hoped his musk would help settle his lover. He was pleased they were given the time to nuzzle before the already-detested voice spoke once more.</p><p>"As I have told Uist, the rules here are simple, Sholto. If at any time you resist or disobey an order, or attempt to escape, your punishment will be borne by your husband as his will be by you. You will now return to your guard."</p><p>With a parting kiss, Sholto reluctantly returned to where the guard stood. He stood passively as the manacle was locked around his wrist. The guard made no attempt to get any closer than necessary. Sholto tried to hide his concern that their captor could instil such fear in his own men. As the guard quickly left Sholto slumped, defeated, on his cot.</p><p>"Now you may both meet your permanent jailor. I can be assured he will neither disobey his orders nor attempt to touch what is forbidden to him. Meet Beast."</p><p>Both Uist and Sholto stared at the being that lumbered into their cell. If its shoulders had not been hunched, it would be as tall as Uist. The arms were loose-jointed, which suggested at suppleness beyond the norm and terminated in gnarled hands with razor-sharp claws. Its legs were thick and powerful. Its visible skin seemed to be scaly. Its face was morbidly fascinating, comprising a skull that was misshapen with a bony growth, like a ridge, a couple of inches above its eye sockets. Its nose was almost flat, with wide nostrils that quivered as it scented the others in the room. The jaw was also deformed, housing an array of uneven, sharp teeth. For all its fearsome and repulsive appearance, the most gruesome thing was the deep brown, very human eyes that gazed almost vacantly at Sholto and then Uist.</p><p>"Beast, scent the one on the wall, then the one on the cot," the disembodied voice commanded. As the creature obeyed the order, the voice continued. "Once he has your scent, he can track you anywhere aboard this station and he will administer any punishments."</p><p>Uist was neither afraid of nor intimidated by the creature and as it turned to head towards Sholto, he growled low and feral.</p><p>Sholto swallowed past his fear. The creature was just going to smell him.</p><p>"This one is special, Beast. He is bearing a child. Become familiar with this aspect of his physiology."</p><p>The creature stretched a single finger towards the swollen stomach of the dark-haired prisoner. It turned its head to see Uist snarling and yanking as hard as he was able to prevent its touch.</p><p>"Please, Uist, stop. I'm fine. Let it touch me," Sholto pleaded. In a much lower voice he added. "Please don't hurt my baby." He closed his eyes as the deadly claw reached closer. However, the touch was so light as to be barely noticeable and, as he opened his eyes, he could see the creature had angled the finger to avoid the claw from potentially scratching his skin. He saw a flicker of ... something ... in the beast's eyes, then the almost-vacant look was back in place.</p><p>"Your stay here is only temporary whilst more suitable accommodation is prepared. We want to ensure your child has a home, after all."</p><p>Sholto felt nausea roll through his body. The thought of his baby, born in the clutches of this man was almost more than he could bear. His hand rubbed over the swell of his belly.</p><p>"We will be found," Uist growled.</p><p>"Oh I'm afraid there is little time for your 'family' to be looking for you. Tristam has been infected with a synthetic virus, effectively rendering his body immobile and shutting off all his senses. Pretty Rayner is naturally at his side and the lizard is trying to find a cure. I can assure you that the delicious Dregan is distraught at your disappearance, but they have more than enough to deal with without trying to find you. You are dismissed, Beast. "</p><p>Uist used every ounce of his Warrior training not to scream his fury and pain. He had heard the lust in the mocking voice when speaking of Theophilus. Rayner's pregnancy was still early and this kind of stress could easily create a problem with his body's acceptance of the artificial womb. His eyes took in the slumped figure of his mate, sitting dejectedly on the small cot. The owner of the loathed voice may not know it, but he was a walking dead man.</p><p>****</p><p>Two full days had passed since Theophilus' world had been turned upside down. Uist and Sholto had vanished, the entire population of the ship they were aboard drugged to kidnap the couple. Almost simultaneously Tristam had been struck down with a paralysing virus. The blond's head pounded with pain and he tried to give a genuine smile to his chosen brother as Rayner stroked his brow. Tristam seemed to be in a coma, unresponsive to any external stimuli, but not to the mental touch of his mate.</p><p>An unexpected side effect to Tristam's condition was his forging a mental link with the blond. Tristam, exclusively communicating with his mind, somehow connected with the blond's inherent empathy and drove it one step further. It allowed Theophilus to remain at Tristam's side whilst Rayner took short breaks. Although Theophilus was overjoyed to be able to do *something*, he still felt it was too little. A true telepath was on his way, but their species preferred to keep their distance from non-telepathic ones. Additionally, Jameson was desperate to keep news of Tristam's vulnerability hidden and so the family friend they chose was still a day or so away from arriving. The mental connection was painful for the Dregan, his mind unused to working in such a way and headaches were frequent for the blond. It was hoped the telepath could both help him strengthen his neural pathways as well as actually communicate with Tristam.</p><p>Theophilus gamely tried to play down the pain, but was unable to hide it from Rayner as the younger men each got used to the feeling of the other in their mind. In addition to Theophilus' nascent ability, another source of future celebration was that his baby reacted to the mental touches of Tristam and Rayner. His eyes grew heavy as his body responded to his pain and growing exhaustion. He felt Rayner's hand move to stroke tenderly over his small bump. The three younger men had taken to rubbing oil over each other's stretching skin to help it retain its suppleness as well as a way of relaxing and enjoying a time of shared intimacy. It made the pain of Sholto's absence even more sharp. As his eyes closed he made a mental vow. 'I have not forgotten you, Uist and Sholto, my beloved brothers. I swear I will not leave it to others to find you.'</p><p>****</p><p>When Theophilus' eyes next opened, he was carefully wrapped and snuggled in the nest he shared with Xavier and, in his husband's absence, was clinging tightly to one of Xavier's lab coats. He rubbed the material over his face, his antennae quivering as he scented his beloved mate. He gave a sad sigh. They were in Jameson and Aurora's home and his husband flitted, well protected, between the hospital facility and the house as he tried to counter-act whatever afflicted Tristam. Theophilus had no doubt he mate would succeed and believed Tristam got more from the experienced touches of Rayner's mind than his own. A tear slid down a porcelain cheek as he rose stiffly, caressing his swell. He *had* to do something. He needed to be looking for Uist and Sholto. There had to be a way he could. There *had* to be. As he stepped from the room, he saw Jameson coming towards him.</p><p>Jameson saw the glint of the crystal tears and hurried to envelope the lithe body in a tight embrace. He was unsure of the cause of the tears, knowing it could just be the youthful male's changing hormones. However, he wanted to offer any comfort he could to Theophilus. Although he and Aurora had fostered many children, they had only adopted three; Tristam, Rayner and Theophilus. The blond would therefore present them with their first grandchild and he had already suffered greatly during what should have been a time of joy for all the family.</p><p>"Oh, Papa," Theophilus finally husked, "I feel so useless."</p><p>"Nonsense," the mature male countered. "Without you Tristam would be alone and adrift when Rayner needs to rest. You care for Rayner when he feels despair and you carry your baby, our first grandchild. You contribute greatly, son."</p><p>"But Uist and Sholto are still missing. I need to do something to help find them. Please, Papa?"</p><p>"Xavier will be back soon," Jameson mused. "Go to your Mama and make sure you eat properly," he chided gently, smiling as Theophilus' cheeks tinted pink. "If Xavier agrees, you can come to HQ with me and review everything we have. Perhaps your sharp eyes will see something another has missed."</p><p>"Truly?" Theophilus asked, his smile emerging like the sun after rain. He hugged Jameson tightly, his step lighter as he hurried to the kitchen to find Aurora.</p><p>Jameson watched the retreating figure with a loving smile. He made a mental vow to ensure he kept Theophilus close to him if Xavier agreed the blond could go with him. He moved to the bedroom of his other sons. He gave a saddened smile as Rayner looked up and bent to hug and kiss the brunette before kissing the cheek of the blond who lay so unmoving. The sight was like a dagger in his heart and Jameson's hand moved to caress the swell of Rayner's abdomen, a gesture he unconsciously copied from Theophilus.<br/></p>"How are you both doing?""Tristam is frustrated," Rayner said. "But he did manage to wriggle his fingers briefly," he added, his eyes glowing with pride for his husband. "I'm a little tired, but Theophilus has been such a tower of strength and his mental touches have meant so much to Tristam. He's just sorry they create the headaches.""Do you think you could spare him for a couple of hours? Although Darius is spearheading the search for Uist and Sholto, Theophilus wants to help.""I'm fine, Papa," Rayner said steadfastly. "It would mean a lot to both of us to know Theophilus is helping to find our brothers. But you need to keep a watch over him; he's only slept a couple of hours. His body will take its own action if he doesn't rest enough.""Now I only have to convince a naturally over-protective Phixian," Jameson said. "Take care of all three of you," he added, giving another kiss to the smiling brunette.Xavier could feel weariness in every cell of his body. He was working to his fullest capacity and had taken just the shortest of naps necessary since the nightmare had begun. He prayed fervently that he had finally cracked the artificial virus' code and that his latest antivirus would work. Soon he would need to sleep properly, but wanted Tristam recovering before he gave into this own needs. He looked up from his work station as Jameson came in."You look as tired as I feel," Jameson said sympathetically as he came to the reptilian. He smiled as Xavier rubbed his snout over his cheeks."I am close to defeating this virus, defeating our adversary," he added, his normally gentle voice dropping to just above a feral growl. "How is Theophilus? ""He fell asleep in a chair, but I carried him to your nest. He was restless until I found one of your coats, ready for laundry, to hold on to. He feels Uist and Sholto's absence keenly and wants to do something to help find them. Would you be agreeable to his accompanying me to Elite HQ to review all the information we have so far? He might see something so small, others have missed it.""I would prefer to keep him at my side," Xavier sighed. "However, he can do nothing to help me with the virus and I know how much he needs to feel he is actively contributing. Even though he does so much here, I entrust him to you to help with our brothers' disappearance. If he finds just one thing others have overlooked, it will mean so much to him.""I have security patrolling HQ," Jameson nodded. "The same as I do here. I'm taking no chances, Xavier."****Theophilus was in Jameson's private office, poring over a small mountain of various data with a dedicated intensity that had the human worrying that the blond was overdoing things. However, the look of single-minded concentration and the clarity in the golden eyes when they briefly glanced in his direction told Jameson it was the right thing to have done. Jameson made a disgruntled sound as he was requested to attend a summit meeting in another office."Theophilus, I have to go for a short while," he said apologetically. 'Make sure you stay here until I get back.""Yes, Papa," the blond said, almost absently, but raised his head with a smile to kiss the mature human. As soon as Jameson had moved away, he returned to what had captured his attention. Uist and Sholto, as well as the others, were fitted with tiny crystal implants which acted as a distress call and homing beacon. Even if they had been unable to activate their normal communications, these should have activated automatically. No record of any communication or signal had been made, but Theophilus had found an anomaly. Not content with looking for record of any transmission, the blond had opted to review radio waves received at the HQ. He had found a wave, around the time of his brothers' disappearance that had nothing to explain its origin or nature. He checked it again before copying it to Jameson and Darius.He sat back, stretching. A twinge made him realise how long he had been sitting and he opened the office door."Is everything alright, Theophilus?" A burly security guard asked as the blond stepped into the corridor."I am quite well, thank you," Theophilus smiled. "I just need the bathroom."Having taken care of his twinge, Theophilus now splashed water over his face to refresh himself. He intended to try and follow up the radio wave and track it to a message, certain it was from Uist or Sholto. As he turned to leave, another Elite officer came rushing in. Theophilus instantly recognised him as the newest member of Darius' team who was replacing an established member injured in a recent accident. Darius had told Theophilus the brunette was very good but overly ambitious, already planning his next move up to Captain in the Elite."I have some great news," he grinned at Theophilus. "We've located Uist and Sholto and our ship is one of the rescue fleet. If you come now, you can join us.""I need to let Jameson know where I am," Theophilus said, subconsciously letting the other man's apparent excitement infect him and be guided away from Jameson's office."I'll call Darius," the brunette said as they hurried down the corridor. "He can call him from the ship as we're on our way. We need to move quickly."Theophilus nodded. He would be safe with Darius and he did not have to be part of any actual fighting. He was looking forward to being at his brothers' rescue.****Uist ignored his stomach's protest of lack of food. He was freed twice a day to exercise and take care of personal hygiene. Only on one of those times was he fed. He could understand the rationale. Of the two, he was the Warrior and most likely to cause his kidnappers problems. By keeping him barely fed, he was being weakened. As a PrideHomer it would be a much slower process than if he were human, but slowly and insidiously his strength would fade. The position of his body, arms stretched up to their full capacity and legs spread wide also took its toll, leaving him stiff and slow in his movements when free.Sholto was, in contrast, well taken care of. However, without Xavier's anti-emetic and under the stress of their imprisonment, he was barely able to eat what he was given. Uist's heart ached with each time he heard Sholto fail to keep food or drink down. His mate was being given preparations to counteract the sickness, but none had succeeded. His beloved, young mate looked pale and wan and Uist wanted nothing more than to rip their kidnapper into bloody shreds."I have a surprise for you both," the detested voice assailed Uist's ears and he looked towards the door that slid silently open. This time he was unable to stop his yowl of pain and anger and it rang in pained harmony with Sholto's cry of denial.Theophilus staggered a couple of steps inside the room, before being shoved so hard by his guard that he stumbled to the floor on his hands and knees."Enough!" The disembodied voice bellowed. "You will report to your commander for immediate punishment, Guard Five. You were warned the Dregan was not to be harmed or touched. Beast, report to cell three."Theophilus did truly feel awful, his stomach and his child both protesting the effects of the drugged drink he had innocently drunk, but he was not as helpless as he let his captors believe. He looked from behind the waterfall of blond hair to note the camera that spied on his family and Uist struggling vainly against strong restraints. Fearful the cat-man would be hurt, he took a deep breath to steady himself and then threw himself into his helpless act once more. He rose to his feet and, looking as though he had only just seen and recognised Uist, staggered forward to collapse gratefully against the strong chest."Uist, Uist," he murmured repeatedly. The feel of the PrideHomers face rubbing against his and the comforting scent of his musk seem to settle his protesting body and baby. He clung tightly to the bigger male. "It was one of the Elite. He said they had found you, and I so wanted to be a part of your rescue." He knew he was not saying anything their captors did not know."Hush, hush, Beautiful," Uist crooned. He began a low rhythmic purr that always seemed to soothe the blond. It would also serve to cover the soft whisper. "We are monitored," was barely more than a puff of air into Theophilus' elegant pointed ear."Corner of the room to your left," Theophilus whispered back, equally quietly.Uist hid his smile in Theophilus' neck. His scent was beginning to mask the smell of fear and others that tainted the blond's normal sweetness. Although still vibrating with barely-controlled fury, he was marginally appeased that the Dregan was not as weak as he was letting their captor believe. He gazed intently into Theophilus' face as the blond pulled back a little to look at him. He could see the tiny lines around anxious golden orbs that told of pain and exhaustion and dark smudges that spoke of lack of sleep."Sholto?" Theophilus asked, his voice worried."Behind you, Beautiful," Uist replied.Theophilus gave a soft cry of anger and denial and moved quickly to hold tightly to his other beloved brother.Although Uist would rather bite off one of his own limbs than see Theophilus imprisoned, too, he could see an almost immediate improvement in Sholto's demeanour. Some of his mate's innate feistiness was returning as he became instinctively protective of the blond."How can you treat him so?" Theophilus asked the camera angrily. "He is with child.""You look even more beautiful when angry, pretty Dregan," the disembodied voice replied silkily.Uist's growl was deep and feral. He could *hear* the lust. He glanced at Theophilus who seemed oblivious as he focused on Sholto and the meagre comforts the cell offered. He watched puzzled as Sholto was ushered behind the screen and there were sounds of tearing material. Uist's heart swelled with love and pride for the blond when the couple next appeared. Sholto now wore the flowing pants that Theophilus had discarded, torn off at the lower leg to account for the difference in their height. The blond now only wore a loose shift that skimmed mid-thigh. Uist did not miss the hitch in their jailor's breath at the sight of long, bare legs."The rules here are very simple, pretty Dregan. Disobey orders and your friends bear your punishment. Now let me introduce you to your personal jailor."Theophilus looked with a mix of shock and pity at the creature that entered. He noted Sholto did not flinch away and knew enough not to simply judge by outward appearance.Beast stared. He had thought the red one pretty, but this new creature was above any words he had for beauty. The golden one stood, not showing any revulsion, simply looking and waiting."This one is also pregnant, Beast. Scent him well."Theophilus wanted to scuttle away, but felt the reassuring squeeze from Sholto. Instead, he tried to stand unflinching and whispered softly."Please do not hurt my child."His anxious eyes met Beast's shuttered gaze and for a moment he saw the pain the creature kept hidden. He realised that the clawed hand had stopped millimetres from his swollen belly and that the creature was hiding from their captor that he was not actually touching the blond. Trusting his instincts, Theophilus carefully shifted to allow the gnarled appendage to come into contact with his stomach and covered it with his own."He is my first. Can you feel him?" Theophilus whispered.Beast did indeed feel him, both as a movement under his hand as well as a strange flutter in his mind. The tiny one was distressed and unthinkingly he rubbed with a finger as though able to reassure he meant no harm."Beast is one of our successes, pretty Dregan. The ultimate foot soldier, bred to be obedient and fearful to behold. All he knows is how to obey, kill and survive. Imagine an army of such creatures.""I have no such desire," Theophilus said angrily, his attention immediately focusing on the camera. "It is immoral to create such beings."Beast could feel the beautiful one's anger and knew it was directed away from him. He surreptitiously glanced at the other prisoners; warrior and pretty red one. The three were so different and yet he could feel their affection for each other almost as a physical entity in the room. The beautiful one's hand still covered his, out of sight of the camera. Beast was only touched for examination or when fighting. This was the only gentle touch he had known and it caused a strange stirring in his chest. He withdrew the hand carefully and blinked, stunned, by the light of the smile bestowed upon him."You look so tired, my brother," Theophilus said, effectively dismissing the disembodied voice. He manoeuvred them into the cot, mindful of two swollen bellies and covered them as best he could. He smiled as Sholto burrowed his face into his neck and hair and breathed deeply, the auburn haired human asleep in seconds. He could feel sleep pulling insidiously at him, too. He was overdue his husband's potion and knew he would be tiring quickly from now on."They need rest. They are both exhausted," Uist growled."And they shall have all the rest they need. Beast, you are dismissed."Uist watched the creature amble out and then his eyes returned to the two sleeping young males. Intellectually he knew that Theophilus was chronologically older, but to him, the blond would always be the baby of their group. He was both proud of, and grateful for, Theophilus putting Sholto's needs first, caring immediately for his beloved mate. He could tell Sholto was having his most restful sleep, wrapped in the Dregan's arms, since their imprisonment began. Silently he invoked Bloodfeud, for the mistreatment of his mate, of those under his Protection and of those he loved as brothers. He would not be content until he had eviscerated the still-living body of their nemesis.****Sholto awoke slowly. The familiar scent and caring arms making him temporarily forget where he was. He smiled at his brother and then reality crashed in. He was hugged tightly and Theophilus' voice was a caress of air in his ear."If we do not fight soon, we will be too weak to try. Your sickness is sapping your strength, tiredness will sap mine and I can hear how empty your husband's stomach is.""We will be fed soon," Sholto whispered back. "Uist will be allowed to move and his stiffness will ease. If we fail, we will be punished. Especially Uist," he added, concern colouring his tone."If we do nothing our babies will be born in captivity and then escape will be impossible. I could not leave my child," Theophilus said."They can't possibly know how to care for a pregnant Dregan," Sholto said, suddenly anxious. "They'll think you have an artificial womb, too. You could die if they can't look after you as you need."A half growl had both men stretching as unobtrusively as possible to look over at Uist. His face as averted as much as possible from the camera and he mouthed the words 'We fight.'****A couple of hours later, the three were making their mental preparations. Sholto feared for his husband, knowing their captor seemed fascinated by his and Theophilus' pregnancies. But, as his blond brother had observed, he would also be reluctant to punish Uist too severely as that could trigger an adverse reaction in Sholto. Neither of them believed the cat-man would be punished lightly, but held tight to the thought their adversary wanted all three alive.Theophilus broke the one of the links holding Sholto's manacle to the rest of the chain. The blond then skirted along the wall as Uist theatrically attempted to stretch, hoping if anyone was watching they would focus on his obvious movements. With an athletic leap, the blond grabbed the camera and wrenched it from the wall as Uist made a preternatural effort and wrenched his arms free. He immediately attacked an ankle restraint as Theophilus helped with the other and then his claws and strength forced open the cell door.Sholto and Uist followed Theophilus as the blond retraced his steps, hoping to lead his brothers to the shuttle hangar he had been brought from. A group of station security appeared before them and the trio instantly moved into fighting mode.Sholto found himself lifted and moved so quickly that his head spun and his stomach protested. He looked up with a groan to find Beast crouched menacingly over him. His eyes instantly went wide with fear, but he realised that the creature seemed to be studying him, as though unsure of the action to take.In his turn, Beast did not know what stayed his hand. A swift blow would render the pretty red-head unconscious with minimal harm the way he had been ordered. The command echoed in his head. 'Capture, subdue, secure.' He tilted his head: fear, nausea and pain radiated in waves from the man beneath him. His eyes travelled to the swollen belly."You will not hurt him," Theophilus' voice rang out.Beast and blond tumbled together away from the still-stunned Sholto; however, the beast easily ensured he ended up stride the weaker form. Furious at the attack, he instinctively raised a clawed hand ready to rend fragile flesh. At the whimper of pain, his hand froze. He realised he was all but sitting on the blond's pregnant swell. Immediately he moved, staring mesmerised at the fluid seeping from golden orbs. His hand shook as he caught a single crystal drop."He was trying to protect me," Sholto's voice came from behind him and he turned to look at the red-head. "Please don't hurt him or his baby."Beast moved away, staring at the beautiful golden one and pretty red-head."We cannot let our babies be born here," Theophilus husked, turning to regard the unmoving creature. "We must try and escape while we have strength. We cannot ask you to help us, but please understand we need try and get free."Beast stood and watched as the two young men moved to join Uist, just as another group of station security arrived, these armed with metal batons. He watched the fight, wondering why he was not obeying his orders. It was apparent that pregnancy hampered the movements of the young men and Beast heard himself growl as the golden one shoved the red one to avoid a baton striking his head. Instead it connected with his shoulder and the arm dropped limply with a cry of pain. However, in protecting him, the golden one felt himself open to attack. Although able to pirouette away from the weapon, it still connected heavily with his lower back. A shout of denial coincided with the golden one crumbling to the floor, where two gathered ready to kick him.Beast had always obeyed orders. It was what he had been trained to do, but here, now, he made a decision of his own; one that was borne of neither blind obedience nor fear. With an inhuman shriek that caused those that should have been his allies to freeze, he struck. Within seconds, none stood save himself and the other Warrior who regarded him warily. He ignored the look in favour of the pretty ones.Sholto was trying to help Theophilus who keened softly in pain."Uist, his baby?" Sholto asked his mate, his voice trembling with fear.The cat-man tenderly caressed over Theophilus' swell."Agitated, but otherwise he seems well," Uist replied."He...is strong. Like...his Papa," Theophilus panted."Like his Mater," Uist contradicted gently, smiling at the blond. "Theophilus, can you stand if we help you? We have to move from here.""I...can stand," Theophilus asserted.Uist then noticed his lover's injured arm and felt his heart sink. He had taken several hard baton blows himself, his speed and agility less than they would normally be. His body ached and he could feel blood tricking down his cheek from a blow to his head. If Sholto and Theophilus were unable to protect themselves, their escape attempt was doomed. He was torn between the two men in regards care; one was his beloved mate, the other his beloved chosen brother.<br/>He helped both to stand and then it seemed disaster was about to strike. He saw Sholto's face drain of colour and he moved swiftly to scoop his fainting husband into his arms. Even as he did, he saw Theophilus sway and the blond's knees begin to buckle.Beast stood and watched the interplay. He had always been told that to care for others was a weakness and that if any accompanying him on a mission were injured they were to be left behind. Yet with these men, caring each for the other was paramount and seemed to give them an innate strength to go on where alone they might falter. He could see the pretty red one losing all colour and being swept into caring arms. His eyes then moved to the beautiful golden one. He copied Uist's action as the blond began to crumple and turned terrified eyes onto the Warrior.In other circumstances, the look in the Beast's eyes would have made Uist laugh out loud. The creature was petrified. Uist understood that it was most likely that the Beast had never shown care or compassion for another before and genuinely did not know what to do with an injured comrade; except perhaps to leave them where they fell."They are both exhausted. Pregnancy and being here, under these circumstances, is sapping their strength. I have to get them away. Will you help?"Beast did not reply, his jaw not designed to allow speech. It was as much a weapon for tearing and rending as the non-retractable claws. Instead, with a burst of speed that caused the Warrior to raise his eyebrows, he sped in and out of the bank of lifts. He sent two sideways, one upwards and ushered the Warrior and his precious bundle into the last. That one he sent downwards. Beast was certain down was safest. He knew what was down there and the Naturals he lived amongst shunned the lower level as much as possible.Golden eyes opened slowly. Theophilus gazed at the visage of the being that cradled him to a powerful chest. He studied the shape of the misshapen jaw and raised a tired hand to touch it gently."My husband is a wonderful physician. He may be able to help you to speak."Beast knew the golden one was waking and prepared himself for the rejection that was certain to come. He found himself holding his breath as he was subjected to non-judgemental scrutiny. He felt the same strange feeling in his chest at the caress to his face and the softly spoken words. However, the hand fell away and Beast felt the body go limp. He panicked and grunted his agitation."His body is taking care of the child he bears," Uist said. "He is pushing himself too hard. Do you understand?"Beast nodded. He had been forced to push his body to the limits of its endurance. Nothing he had ever done in this place had been by choice...until now. He gazed at the unconscious form. He made another choice. He would protect both young ones and their unborn. No creature born in the outside world should suffer as he, and his...family...had suffered.Sholto woke groggily and nestled closer in his mate's protective hold."Theophilus?" He asked thickly."The Beast carries him," Uist replied as he followed the creature that ambled rapidly ahead of him. He could see closed doors at the end of the smooth grey-walled corridor and could scent the creature's growing agitation. He wondered what it was that had the creature so concerned. His curiosity was assuaged as they entered in essence cell after cell of, if Beast was considered a success, what could only be called failures.Uist felt Sholto bury his face in his shoulder and cradled him closer and tighter. Hate, fear, pain and desolation filled the air and made it barely breathable. Some creatures had powerful bodies, but gazed vacantly, saliva oozing continually from their mouths; others had limbs incapable of supporting torsos, or necks unable to hold up huge, distorted heads. A few snarled and rabidly tried attacking them. However, even they backed away at Beast's own savage snarls. Uist refused to consider why they were being kept alive, striding forward, avoiding looking directly at any of them.Theophilus' head lifted and Uist heard the Beast make soft sounds, clearly trying to make the blond resume his sleep."Uist," came the gentle voice. "Their pain.""We can do nothing for them now, Beautiful," Uist replied. "When we get out of here, we can tell Papa and he will deal with this." The cat-man was certain the best that could be done for them was to put them out of their misery.Beast felt the golden one's compassion and he could see some of his family had felt it, too. He felt a strange burning in his eyes and fluid seeped from one eye. For all he had suffered in this place, the beautiful one actually cared for those around them. The other Naturals only came here to torment or to take one or another away. Some never returning. He made as soft a sound as he was capable of creating and tightened his grip, hoping the golden one would sleep again. The Warrior was right. There was nothing that could be done for those in these cells. They would welcome death.Uist's heart sank at the sight of the guards waiting for them at the hangar bay Beast had led them to. He had known it was always going to be the case, but the finality still hit hard. He had prayed for a miracle that the three of them could have escaped together. Reluctantly he set Sholto on his feet."I will distract the guards, Mine and you must get away with Theophilus. Send help for me as soon as you are able.""Uist, no," Sholto moaned, holding tightly to his mate with his one good arm."You and Theophilus cannot protect yourselves and Theophilus cannot pilot a ship in his state. You have to take care of our unborn and our brother.""I don't want to leave you," Sholto husked. The reality of having to leave his husband behind had not occurred to the younger man and tears fell freely."Of course you will not," Theophilus' voice was soft but strong. He stood at Beast's side, ignoring every ache and instinct that demanded he find somewhere to lie and sleep. "You and Uist will leave together. Beast will be able to claim he recaptured me. Our nemesis wants me, not just my child," he added, his voice faltering. "Please let Xavier know how much I love him and that I do what I must to protect our child. Knowing you and your child are free and safe will make ...what I may have to endure...easier."Beast stood as a silent sentinel. He was not as lacking in intellect as his creators assumed and he knew what the golden one alluded to. He had also heard the undisguised lust in his master's voice. He hoped, that for once, his jaw could do something other than tear or rend. He had learned enough from the three men to understand the concept of self-sacrifice. But that was not all. He had also seen courage, determination, fortitude and love. He would not leave the golden one to fall once more into the hands of his master."Go." Beast herded the golden one towards the others, giving the swollen belly a last caress. "Pro...tect."Uist blinked. He had not expected this. He could see Sholto and Theophilus were equally stunned and he stepped forward, carefully holding the arm of the Beast in a warrior's clasp."A true Warrior is a Protector," he said, meeting the Beast's eyes."Thank you," Sholto whispered, not knowing what else to say or do."Thank you, my friend," Theophilus added, pressing a chaste kiss to a rough, misshapen cheek.Uist wrapped an arm around each slender male as they ran towards a shuttle, Beast's eerie and inhuman cry echoing around the hangar. He growled his disappointment that the ship had only two seats."We will fit in one," Theophilus said with determination.The seat reclined and the two men lay on their sides, wrapping their arms around one another as Uist buckled them in securely. He devoured his mate's mouth before pulling reluctantly away. He pressed his lips to Theophilus', knowing it could be the last time he kissed either beautiful young man."Hold tight," he growled as he took his place and sent the ship speeding from the station."Thank you for coming for us, Theophilus," Sholto murmured, kissing the blond. "I love you.""You would have done no less, my brother," Theophilus replied. "You and Uist are both beloved to me."Sholto felt the blond go limp, his body finally giving in to pain and exhaustion. He buried his face in blond tresses and closed his eyes, praying Uist could get them to safety.Uist took a few moments to recognise where they were by the star systems around him and then sent the ship hurtling in the direction of Earth. He was not surprised to see a couple of pursuit ships give chase. They could not be allowed to escape. They knew too much. He used every ounce of his Warrior's training and cunning to pilot the ship to frustrate his pursuers."Sholto, are we going home?" Theophilus' voice was barely above a whisper in the red-head's ear and sounded so lost and child-like that Sholto felt the tears burning his eyes."Yes, Beautiful," he replied. "We're going home.""Miss Xavier..." Theophilus' voice trailed off and Sholto nuzzled the unresponsive blond, swallowing past the lump in his throat."Uist will take us home," he whispered, knowing Theophilus could no longer hear him. He groaned as the ship tilted and swerved and nestled closer, clinging tightly to the blond.A triumphant yowl rang out as Uist recognised a large ship with two smaller out-riding Elite vessels. 'Silver' had never looked so welcoming. A second yowl quickly followed as a recognised and loved voice came through his ship's communications."Uist, Sholto, Theophilus, just keep coming. We'll take care of your pursuers. Come aboard in the spare bay."Uist did not know or care how Tristam had found them. All he cared about was that his brother had clearly overcome the virus and that they were all safe. Explanations could wait. Without hesitation he manoeuvred his vessel into position, his loud purrs of joy reverberating inside the small craft as it came to rest inside 'Silver'.Xavier was aboard the escape ship before Uist had time to begin to move Sholto and Theophilus apart. Uist shook his head as he saw the reptilian assessing his hurts."Tend to the young ones," he said. "It is mostly exhaustion and sickness, but they were also hit by metal batons." The low deep trill from the Phixian was as good as any feral growl of rage Uist was capable of and he nodded his agreement. Carefully they carried the precious bundles from the ship to be greeted by Rayner and Tristam. Uist noted the exhaustion in Tristam's eyes and the way his commander and chosen brother leant heavily on his smaller husband."If it were not for your mate and his courage and strength, Sholto and I would still be prisoners of our abductor. I owe him a debt I can never truly repay," Uist said. "During our incarceration I invoked Bloodfeud and will make a public declaration as quickly as I am able.""Good," Xavier said, his tail lashing from side to side, a clear indicator of the reptilian's fury. "This man cannot continue to hurt us. There can be no peace for me or my family, even those on Phixia, until this threat has been dealt with.""He did not desire just our unborn," Uist said quietly as they made their way to sick bay via one of the ship's lifts. "He also made it clear he desired your mate, my brother." He met the furious reptilian's gaze evenly and received a nod from Xavier. Uist knew that the unspoken promise of retribution that burned brightly in his eyes was sufficient for the agitated lizard."Rayner and I will bring you up to date with what has happened at Elite HQ when you are rested, Uist," Tristam said, his voice weak and quiet. "Bloodfeud was invoked by your Sire and has been taken up by many of your extended family. It has also been taken up by friends and family from other worlds. Like a stone in a still pond, ripples are radiating ever outwards, my brother. We *will* find this man. Xavier, keep Rayner and me posted regarding Theophilus and Sholto. I want to follow those pursuit ships back to their destination."On the bridge, Tristam refused to let Rayner sit anywhere but his lap, reassuring himself his own beloved mate was safe and well."I'm fine, love," Rayner said, nuzzling his mate, letting love and reassurance flood the older man's mind to replace the anxiety he could feel."He would have... Sholto and Theophilus..." Tristam could hardly bear to think, much less say what was going round his mind in circles. A still-shaky hand constantly caressed Rayner's small bump. He was staring at the view screen which showed the small station where his family had been imprisoned and on which they were closing quickly."He would have hurt them, very badly," Rayner supplied, his voice soft and angry. "But we are all safe and free. Hopefully we will soon have something more concrete to work on."However, even as the brunette spoke, a series of explosions concluded with one that engulfed the station in fire. The ship's AI automatically darkening the screen to account for the flare of light that filled it. Both men groaned their frustration. It seemed that for each step they took closer to their adversary, he was able to take another further away. However, as the debris and dust began to clear, Tristam leant forward, craning his enhanced vision. He gave a small smile. There was something out there he considered worth investigating.****Theophilus gave a soft mewl of pleasure as his mate's sexes caressed his jewel. He lay on his side, head pillowed on Xavier's left arm. His husband's tail rippled around his own primed shaft and a large hand tweaked his swollen, sensitive nipples with perfect pressure to add to the sensual delight. Theophilus was not sure which of them needed the intimacy more; he was just grateful that after a few hours rest, his body was able to make slow, gentle love with his adored husband. Xavier was barely moving inside his sheath, just the tiniest movement to tease his sweet spot and build his arousal with infinite care."I love you so much, my heart," Xavier whispered, his tongue licking at Theophilus' bare shoulder and earning him a tightening of the channel that gripped his hemipenes and a whimper of need as the blond reached back to grip tightly at his powerful thigh."I would have your seed inside me, my husband," Theophilus moaned."And so you shall," Xavier's said, his voice a caress of dark silk against Theophilus' ear. He formed his knot and increased the speed of the ripples around the blond's shaft, adding a rhythmic contraction to add to the sensual miasma. His teeth nipped and nibbled and he trilled with joy as Theophilus reached his pinnacle. As his lover's seed pulsed over his tail, he released his own deep into the molten depths."Thank you, beloved," Theophilus murmured. He craned his head and was rewarded with his husband's tongue sliding into his mouth in the kiss he craved. Already the languid afterglow was sinking him insidiously back into sleep."I will be here, my love," Xavier crooned tenderly. "Sleep safe in my arms." He smiled as he realised Theophilus was already slumbering. Nuzzling as close as possible, the reptilian let himself join his mate in the first true sleep he had been able to enjoy since the nightmare began.****Uist smiled lovingly at the precious bundle curled against him and sleeping soundly. He knew his mate would be annoyed when he awoke. Sholto had been adamant that he wanted to make love when they retired to bed. Uist had seemingly capitulated, shaking his head at Xavier to stop the concerned physician from adding his protest. Uist knew his mate was too tired as yet.They had lain together, kissing and stroking gently before Uist had began a leisurely and thorough licking of his mate's body, from his hairline to his toes, judiciously avoiding Sholto's groin on the way down. By the time he had sucked tenderly on his lover's toes. The younger man was fast asleep, never having got more than half-hard. Uist ignored his own erection. He would make love with his mate when Sholto had rested. With a satisfied purr, Uist finally allowed his body the rest it needed.Sholto's eyes opened slowly and he did not know whether to kiss his mate senseless or be furious. He gave a mental sigh. In all honesty Uist had been right. He had not been up to making love when they had first retired to bed. He glanced up at his sleeping lover. The PrideHomer's lips were curved in a small smile and the sound of soft purring demonstrated how content the bigger male now was. Sholto's heart melted. With a smile of his own, he carefully worked his way to be level with Uist's furred groin. Tenderly he extracted his mate's sex which seemed to recognise the hands that held it, instantly starting to swell.Sholto began to suck softly, letting his tongue swirl over the domed head and tease the tiny slit. He hummed happily as his mate's pre-come began to fill his mouth, the musky taste both comforting and arousing. He took it a little deeper, sliding up and down before returning to slow suction of just the flared and swollen head. He smiled as Uist's hips began to move slowly, matching his rhythm."Imp." The single word was spoken in a sexy, rasping purr and Sholto smiled up at his mate who was regarding him with an indulgent smile. "Roll over," the cat-man added, with a hint of growl.Sholto quickly moved to lie on his back, his legs spread wide, as his lover loomed over him. Uist knelt with his legs either side of Sholto's head, allowing the young man to continue his gentle sucking. The bigger man supported his upper body on his forearms, his hands wrapped around Sholto's thighs, keeping them wide-spread. His greater height ensuring he could not only work Sholto's eager shaft, but lean forward and lick at his perineum and hidden entrance. Sholto moaned his appreciation. Uist's hot, hungry mouth devoured his erection and swallowed around the aching orbs in his sac. A slick, agile muscle probed insistently at his furled flesh and then Uist sucked insistently at his shaft as a knowledgeable finger sank inside to caress his jewel. His mate's erection was forgotten as Sholto wailed through his orgasm, his crème swallowed greedily by his attentive husband.Sated and boneless, Sholto was unresisting as Uist positioned his lover on his side. The cat-man pressed his shaft between Sholto's thighs and thrust hard and fast. The bigger male was unable to be fully inside his mate as it made Sholto too uncomfortable. He nipped and nibbled at the warm, bare flesh of the younger man's shoulder and neck, the soft moans of pleasure like sweet music to Uist's ears. He came with a yowl of joy. He kissed his lover tenderly in the afterglow, hiding his smile as Sholto struggled valiantly to remain awake. He quickly licked Sholto clean and then cradled his sleeping mate to his chest as Sholto lost the battle. Uist fully intended that after the recent ordeals they had all suffered, he was going to indulge all three pregnant men as much and as often as he could.He lay awake, guarding his husband's sleep, letting his mind replay the events of their imprisonment, and making mental notes of the sound of their abductor's voice, its timbre and inflection. He was quite certain he would recognise it again.****Rayner and Tristam lay entwined together, the older man's body still too weak to consider anything more intimate. They smiled as they kissed, letting their minds pleasure each other where their bodies were unable."It feels strange to have another in charge of 'Silver', Tristam murmured, nibbling tenderly at the fragile flesh of his mate's throat."Darius isn't in charge, my love. You are still commander. You just need to rest for a couple more days. Xavier is more than happy with your body's progress and the speed it's regaining its strength. Better to have Darius and a couple of his men taking care of the ship whilst we are all too exhausted. Even Xavier needed to sleep. Don't forget Darius feels responsible for Theophilus' abduction. Technically Nairi was one of his men. We're so lucky that Theophilus found that signal and we could trace it to Nairi. That, along with the security guard seeing him at the time of Theophilus' disappearance was more than enough to question him."<br/>"I don't think I have ever seen Xavier so angry," Tristam whispered. "A part of me wondered if he would tear Nairi apart after the traitor confessed. But it's still hard for me. I have never left another outside of our family in charge," Tristam said with a sigh. "If we were unable the AI took command. But you're right. Given the current circumstances it is safer to have Darius here.""Rest, love," Rayner insisted, tucking the blond head against his shoulder, smiling as he felt the bigger man nestle close. It was rare that he was the one offering succour; his mate was always so strong, capable and dependable. He hugged the older man tight as soft lips pressed a final kiss to his neck."I love you, angel," Tristam whispered, letting his body relax and complete the healing it needed."Love you, too," Rayner replied, dropping a kiss into tousled tresses.****Awareness came slowly, the battered body aching and feeling strange and unresponsive. A mental check began starting at toes and moving slowly upwards. At one point, it had seemed as if survival was an unattainable dream and yet here he was. His left leg was healing, nanobots working in conjunction with his own natural abilities. The same went for his left arm. He knew his leg was not quite fully aligned correctly, healing having begun whilst it was in the wrong position. He could not tell how compromised his speed would be. His face still felt intact, but he felt a cold chill down his spine as he realised he only had one eye. Even he could not regenerate destroyed organs or limbs. He let his sense of smell reach out. He knew there were others watching him. Two he did not recognise. But the third...His good eye opened instantly."It is good to see you awake, my friend," Uist said. "Let me introduce you to my chosen family. This is Tristam and Xavier who are as brothers to me. Tristam, Xavier, this is the one called Beast who helped us escape from our abductor."Beast stared. The blond looked every bit the perfect mate for the beautiful golden one. He was surprised to see that the other was reptilian. He seemed so different from the others and yet Beast could feel the affection flowing between the men. Some of his much manipulated genetic material had been of reptilian origin. But his had been from animal, not intelligent, species. He turned his eye pleadingly back to Uist, his right hand opening and closing, hoping the Warrior could understand what he wanted."They are as anxious to see you as you are them, my friend," Uist laughed, certain he knew what the creature wanted."You are welcome aboard our ship, my friend," Tristam said as Uist moved away. "Only those I trust know you survived the station's destruction. We deemed it safer for you."Beast felt the strange sensation in his chest again. These people were caring for and protecting him. He reached to the blond and his hand was carefully clasped. Then more familiar scents reached his sensitive nostrils and he looked towards the advancing group as his hand was released.A pretty dark one led the way and took his place at Tristam's side."This is my husband, Rayner," Tristam said, smiling lovingly into deep brown orbs. "He is pregnant, too."Beast was stunned. He hesitantly reached to touch the small swell and got an even stronger flutter in his mind than from the golden one's unborn."It would seem Beast has some mental abilities his creators were unaware of," Tristam observed as he let Rayner mould to his frame."Hi," Sholto said, moving forward in his turn. It's good to see you looking so well." Sholto grinned as the somewhat shaky hand caressed his bump. He snickered as Beast's eye widened at the activity under his hand. "I think he's pleased, too."Beast's attention then focused on the golden one. He could scarcely believe that the beautiful blond was the mate of the large reptilian, but there was no doubting the love that flowed between them or the look of adoration in expressive golden orbs."Did I not tell you my husband was a wonderful physician?" Theophilus asked, as Sholto moved away to be embraced by his mate whose hand covered his swell. The couple smiled together at the energetic motions of their child."Xavier will take very take very good care of you, Alden,"Beast looked questioningly, then anxiously as the golden one looked shocked and then upset."I...I did not mean to offend..." he began, but was pulled into an embrace by his mate before he could become too agitated."I am sure our friend will not be offended, my heart," Xavier crooned softly."We've been looking for names for our babies," Sholto explained. "Theophilus liked Alden, which means 'friend'. We were all sure you would prefer something other than the name used at the station."The beast felt liquid seep from his eye. The golden one, no Theophilus, had cared enough to find him a name and had given him one meaning 'friend'. He reached towards him making a supreme effort to move his jaws."Al...den good," he managed. It was worth the effort. He was almost blinded by the intensity of the smile from Theophilus and could happily have basked in its warmth forever. As he found himself awkwardly, but thoroughly, hugged, he let his good hand move up and down the slender back in the caress he had seen both Xavier and Uist give their mates.As Theophilus returned to Xavier's arms, the reptilian checked the monitor above the injured male."I think we should let Alden rest more, boys," he said, ushering the three younger men towards the door. "You can always come back later.""You will be under the protection of Earth Elite," Tristam said quietly when the pregnant men had gone. "You may be able to help us find the man who did this to you and who has hurt me and my family."Alden felt the anger and hate from the three powerful males. He also felt an echo of the pain Tristam had mentioned. He gave a low, feral growl. His creator deserved no chosen loyalty from him. He chose to assist the men he was with. If he could help, he would. He nodded as best he could.Xavier touched the misshapen jaw."When you have healed fully from these injuries, I can do something about your lost eye. I can replace it with either a fully organic or a part-organic, the choice will be yours. And," he added almost casually, "I am certain I can do something to help make speaking easier for you."Alden grasped the reptilian, looking desperately at him. The eye would be an added bonus, but to speak..."You were right, my brother," Xavier smiled at Uist. "He can indeed convey much without speech. Rest now, Alden," he said, his professional, physician persona taking over. "You have much healing to undergo before I perform any additional surgery."****EpilogueTristam groaned his pleasure as a soft tongue bathed one nipple before open-mouthed kisses led to its twin receiving the same caress. Gentle hands stroked his chest and sides as Rayner moved lower and lower, nuzzling into the thick nest of blond curls that haloed Tristam's erection."Gods, yes, yes," Tristam husked as the gentle tongue laved his sac. He felt tender hands palm his cheeks and spread him and he whimpered his need. He moaned low and wanton as Rayner began to lick at his tightly furled flesh. He spread his legs wider, canting his hips upwards, silently inviting his mate's more intimate attentions. His groan was long and deep as he felt the slick muscle slip inside him. For long moments, he simply enjoyed the intimate caresses, letting his arousal slowly build until he could resist its demands no longer."Need you, angel," he husked. He felt love and lust boil in his veins as Rayner looked up from between his powerful thighs. The dark hair was bed-mussed, the beloved face flushed, the delectable lips swollen and glistening and Tristam could scent his own dark-musk combining with Rayner's own scent of arousal. His smile was feral as Rayner crawled up his body to straddle him. As Rayner leant forward to mate their mouths, Tristam reached to palm his mate's downy globes and slide his fingers into the stretched and slick passage. His smiled widened as Rayner broke the kiss to throw his head back panting wetly, as he rubbed his husband's jewel, Rayner pushing back on the questing fingers, his engorged shaft dripping onto Tristam's stomach to mix with blond's copious pre-come.Rayner sat up, rising up on his knees. He reached to position his lover's pulsating organ at his aching void and, as Tristam held his cheeks apart, slowly slid down silk-encased obsidian. He moaned his appreciation as the hard, thick shaft seemed to pierce him to his very core. He held still, feeling the rock-hardness pulse its appreciation as his sheath rippled its welcome. He had missed their physical intimacy. Tristam's large hands stroked over his thighs, his chest, thumbing them gently pinching his diamond-hard nipples. Rayner wanted to come and yet wanted this intimacy to go on forever.He undulated slowly, gasping as his jewel was stimulated by his mate's flesh. He mewled as he began to lift and lower, maintaining the rhythmic undulations that pleasured them both. Mental and physical pleasure grew, enveloping them both in a maelstrom of love and desire, passion and pleasure, need and want. Rayner had wanted to make love slowly, but their need was too great. All-too-soon he was riding hard and fast, crying out his pleasure in harmony with his husband, whose hips now snapped upwards increasing their mutual delight.Rayner gave a cry of Tristam's name as his lover's strong hand grasped his bobbing erection and began a series of long strokes, from root to tip, flicking his thumb over the sensitive slit. It took just a few before Rayner could feel his orgasm begin at cell level. Stars danced before his eyes and his body tightened and trembled as wave after wave of ecstasy engulfed him. He felt his sex surge and his seed pulse free to coat Tristam's hand and chest and then wet heat was filling him. He sobbed his husband's name over and over before finally collapsing fully spent on the broad chest.Tristam gave a bellow of primitive triumph as his seed ploughed deep inside his mate's quivering sheath. He relished the feel and scent Rayner's warm release on his body, feeling completed in ways he could never find words to articulate. He caught his mate as Rayner slumped, letting his lover lie on his chest whilst his hips continued with their desultory slide back and forth as his sex slowly softened. Only once forced from his mate's body did Tristam move them both. Tenderly he laid Rayner comfortably on his side and curled protectively around the lithe form, kissing the bare shoulder. He lay awake, holding to the most precious thing in his life, letting Rayner's soft breathing relax and comfort him.Tristam activated his wrist communicator as it signalled an incoming message, its sound at a level too soft to wake his mate. It was Jameson and he listened to the older man with a growing satisfaction and primal need for vengeance.Thanks to Uist's sire, Willis, they had a name.Hiram.Tristam mentally vowed the man would regret every second of anguish he and his family had been made to suffer.

<p>Pelaam© June 2008.</p><p><b>Ch 08: Nemesis</b></p><p>The luxury car was opened by an immaculately uniformed doorman for the smartly dressed executive. He slid comfortably inside, his emerald-green eyes running appreciatively over the car's interior. The seats were leather and roomy and, if needed, could be slipped into a fully reclined position. There was a laptop computer for work and a store of DVDs for entertainment. A small fridge held cold drinks and snack food and there was a matching cabinet holding glasses and drinks that did not require chilling.</p><p>He ran a hand through thick, silver hair as he smiled at himself in a reflective surface. The negotiations had gone well. He now faced a couple of hours drive to reach a tiny airport and from there to a space-port. The world only boasted a few small space-ports, but as its status increased, so would its number of ports.</p><p>Immersed in his reports, and taking advantage of the drink provided, it was an hour later that he realised that his car was taking a tortuous route to the airport. They had left the main road and were currently travelling at speed towards the desert in a circuitous direction to his destination. He rapped on the glass behind his chauffeur.</p><p>"I have no desire to take the scenic route," he barked angrily. His voice had a dry, rasping quality yet possessed power and impatience. It was the voice of a man clearly used to the obedience of those around him.</p><p>"Sit back and enjoy the ride, Jabez. You're taking a little detour."</p><p>Before a darkened screen blocked off Jabez's view of his driver, he caught a glance of him in the vehicle's mirrors.</p><p>"Tristam!" he exclaimed. He tried to use the vehicle's communications and then his own only to find nothing working. His eyes narrowed, becoming as hard and cold as the gem whose colour they bore. Then he shrugged, poured a generous measure of amber liqueur and sat back, lifting his glass in an ironic toast to the now invisible back of his driver.</p><p>****</p><p>Jabez glanced around, his face carved into an expression of boredom. The car was out in the desert. All that could be seen was red rock and orange sand and overhead the sky was a cloudless turquoise as the two saffron suns each reached their zenith.</p><p>"Out of the car, Jabez," Tristam's voice commanded.</p><p>"And if I don't?" Jabez retorted, not even bothering to turn to face the man now standing at the door.</p><p>"Then you stay there."</p><p>Jabez watched as Tristam walked over to sit in the shade of an outcrop of rock. He noted the cool-box from which the blond took a bottle of water. He had been quite certain the other man would not be alone. He idly wondered who else would be watching from the cover of the desert rocks. He also wondered just how long Tristam was prepared to wait. He poured himself another drink. Five minutes passed, then ten...fifteen. Jabez frowned.</p><p>Tristam was paying neither him nor the car any obvious attention. He purposely waited another fifteen minutes, but Tristam simply looked as though he was drowsing in the desert heat. Scowling, Jabez re-filled his glass and began a slow, deliberate saunter to the seated man.</p><p>As he closed the distance, he begrudgingly admired Tristam's obvious, latent power. The blond sat loose-limbed, a dusting of golden fur visible where he had unzipped his chauffeur's uniform. Tristam oozed male, sexual charisma. Jabez gave a wry smile as found his eyes riveted to the other man's movements as Tristam sat up slowly and raised a fresh water bottle to his lips.</p><p>Jabez watched the bobbing motion of Tristam's Adam's apple and coveted the droplet that escaped to slide down the skin of the blond's throat. He bedded both sexes with equal fervour and appetite. Although he preferred beautiful, malleable and accommodating bed-mates he would be more than happy, at that moment, to have the powerful blond on his knees as he slaked his carnal appetite. The surge at his crotch told him his cock was in full accord with that idea. At that moment, sapphire met emerald and Jabez smirked at the disgust in Tristam's cerulean depths.</p><p>He stopped as Tristam stood up. The two men were almost equal in height and breadth and each regarded the other as though something dangerous and volatile.</p><p>"So, Tristam," Jabez let his voice become a low purr. "What brings you to this little nowhere rock? Were you missing me? I've never been kidnapped before. It's a nice isolated area. Are you going to have you wicked way with me? Is it my face you picture when you orgasm inside pretty Rayner?"</p><p>Tristam's stomach rolled in disgust at Jabez's words. Almost immediately he relaxed as a gentle caress flitted through his mind. His beautiful husband might not know the reason for his mate's distress, but the loving touch instantly defused Tristam's anger. Instead a slow, scornful smile spread across his face.</p><p>"Such a vivid imagination, Jabez," he drawled laconically. "Perhaps it's more the case of you dreaming of being taken by me. Sorry, but I don't cheat on my husband. I've no need and you pale into nothing alongside Rayner." He gave a mental smile at the darkening of Jabez's face. The blond knew from personal experience that conceit and arrogance were two of Jabez's weak spots.</p><p>"Wasn't it enough that you all but destroyed my employer's long-established business, Tristam? Are you looking to destroy me, too? Perhaps I should consider a charge of harassment."</p><p>"Hiram Enterprises was investigated by multiple teams of Elite across several worlds," Tristam said slowly, as though addressing a child. "My team investigated your domain and found exactly the same as the others. Hiram Enterprises was employing unethical, inhumane and illegal methods. It was only Hiram's reputation, almost limitless access to funds and an extremely well-skilled legal team that stopped him...and the likes of you...from being incarcerated as was deserved."</p><p>"We lost every contract to supply and develop weaponry for the advanced worlds. It cost us billions in credit. We can only supply hick planets like this with basic stuff sold cheaply until we can rebuild our reputation," Jabez hissed.</p><p>"You deserved worse. Quite frankly I would happily see you and Hiram behind bars for a good many years," Tristam growled. "That you're free to trade at all is a miscarriage of justice. But that's not why we're here."</p><p>"No?" Jabez sneered. "Then what?"</p><p>"Hiram hasn't been seen in public for many years, but you are his eyes and ears. So I want you to deliver a personal message to him. Tell him I know, my family knows. Bloodfeud has been called by Willis, sire of Uist. Wherever Hiram hides, we will find him and be avenged."</p><p>"Is that all?" Hiram asked mockingly.</p><p>"I think that's more than enough," Tristam said, his voice cold and menacing. He had seen the shift in the hard, green eyes and had scented Jabez's surge of anxiety. The man was clearly well-aware of what Tristam alluded to. "But if not, tell him this. Bloodfeud extends beyond PrideHome. Phixia has joined its call as has one of the Aantnaa worlds. Sholto has some good insectile friends."</p><p>Tristam felt grim satisfaction wash over him as Jabez's anxiety increased. The insect-evolved races were renowned for their well-structured society and lawlessness was unknown amongst those dwelling on their homeworlds. Sholto's friends had reacted with fury and a desire for vengeance on hearing of his abduction and treatment as well as what had happened to the others of his family.</p><p>"What are you expecting from him?" Jabez asked.</p><p>"The opportunity to give himself up. To stand trial rather than be dug out from whichever hole he's taken refuge in, confessing his guilt in regards what has happened to me and those I love. Have no doubts, Jabez," Tristam said, his voice dropping to a deadly whisper. "He will be found and those who have had a part in this will also be dealt with."</p><p>He scented Jabez's spike of fear knowing he had struck home.</p><p>"Just the belief you know something is enough for me to kill you. But, this time, you go free. Make sure he understands, Jabez and make sure you understand that if I find you were involved there will be no place of safety for you."</p><p>Jabez stared at Tristam's retreating back, a mix of anger and fear coursing through his veins.</p><p>"Another car will come for you in an hour," came the parting words, the blond not even bothering to turn back.</p><p>****</p><p>In their quarters aboard 'Silver' Rayner sat astride his husband's thighs. He gently undulated his body, letting their swollen shafts rub erotically. Tristam's hands slid along his thighs, over his pregnant swell and up to tease at the peaked nubs at his breast. A moan slid from his parted lips and he gazed down at his mate, smiling at the love he saw there and knowing it reflected the look in his own cinnamon orbs. His smile widened as their minds added subtle caresses to incrementally increase their arousal.</p><p>"Better?" he asked, knowing how his lover had felt whilst facing Jabez.</p><p>"Much," the blond sighed contentedly. He had debriefed those of his family unable to accompany him, taken a hot shower with his beloved mate and finally felt clean and calm. For several long minutes the couple had simply enjoyed skin-to-skin contact but he could feel the need for more growing. He watched Rayner as the younger man begin to rub with a little more urgency. "Let me make love with you, angel?" he asked, suddenly desperate to join with his mate.</p><p>With tender care, he laid Rayner on his side, spooning tightly behind him. Coating a single finger with oil, he rubbed over the hidden entrance to his lover's body, pressing kisses to the bare shoulder in front of him. He nuzzled into Rayner as he slid the digit into molten heat, both men moaning at the intimate act. He reached under and around his lover's waist to stroke slowly at slick, erect flesh, relishing the way his mate eagerly responded. The lithe body pushing back and rocking forward as soft cries of pleasure escaped Rayner's lips.</p><p>"Love you so much," Tristam whispered.</p><p>"Love you, want you," Rayner murmured, trying to increase the tempo of their lovemaking.</p><p>"Gently, love," Tristam soothed. "Let me do all the work." He slid a second oil-drenched finger to begin a caress of Rayner's jewel. Reluctantly he removed his fingers. It was too uncomfortable for his husband to take more than just Tristam's fingers. Although he missed the ultimate physical intimacy, Tristam would do nothing that caused Rayner the least discomfort during his pregnancy.</p><p>Spooning closer Tristam pushed his aching shaft between Rayner's smooth thighs. He started with a slow rhythm, his rod continually weeping its desire and sliding easily back and forth. Incrementally he increased the pace, listening assiduously to the panting breaths and mewls of delight. His hand began a twist and flick at the top-stroke of his movement at the head of his mate's engorged penis, causing Rayner to groan and buck as much as his position would allow.</p><p>"Come for me, angel," Tristam husked. "Take me with you."</p><p>At the words spoken with such raw need, the heat that had been centred low in Rayner's belly began to expand outwards with searing intensity. Rayner's breath came in shallow pants as he felt every cell and synapse melting from the heat of his imminent climax. It was impossible for him to tell if the pleasure he felt was just his or entwined with his lover's as they mentally shared their race to release. He cried out his lover's name as his orgasm detonated and his seed fountained over Tristam's hand.</p><p>"Love you, I love you," Tristam groaned. The waves of pleasure in his mind combined with the feel of his lover's passion pushed him beyond his limits of endurance. He came hard, shuddering with the powerful release and anointing his lover's honeyed skin with his come.</p><p>He licked at his hand, relishing the flavour of his mate's precious cream. He carefully rolled Rayner onto his back, licking the smooth thighs clean, before nuzzling at Rayner's depleted sac and lapping the softening, spent flesh. He bent over the supine form to mate their mouths, their tongues languidly dancing in the satiated afterglow.</p><p>"I love you," Rayner smiled, seemingly glowing with joy. He nestled comfortably against his bigger mate and gave a sated sigh. He snuggled impossibly closer as Tristam's arm wrapped protectively around him and the two men traded soft kisses and declarations of love.</p><p>****</p><p>On the main deck of 'Silver', Uist sat in the command chair, Sholto curled drowsily in his lap. Although the ship's AI was on full alert, they no longer felt safe enough without someone on deck. Uist wanted to let his precious mate sleep more comfortably, but knew Tristam and Rayner needed time to reconnect and it was too close to Theophilus' birthing for the blond to be an active part of the team.</p><p>It was difficult for the PrideHomer to allow any of the pregnant males to be too far from his protection and he was relieved that they took his protectiveness with good grace. He smoothed some of his lover's curls from the beloved face, smiling as Sholto murmured wordlessly and snuggled closer.</p><p>Uist knew Theophilus and Xavier would be in the ship's pool where the Dregan could move most easily, the water supporting his heavily pregnant body. The blond was now at his most vulnerable. He could not be left alone as he was nesting for his imminent birth. Once the instinct kicked in, he became oblivious of anything other than making somewhere safe and comfortable to have his child.</p><p>Uist's smile grew as he remembered some of the places the blond had selected. One nest was at the foot of the bed he shared with Sholto, another was in Tristam and Rayner's room. Whilst they were acceptable, another behind a section of piping in engineering was not. The cat-man shook his head, still finding it hard to believe the blond had negotiated his body in and around the metal tubing. Unsuitable nests were quickly removed and Xavier informed. Uist knew his lizard brother would make certain that Theophilus was left with only those nests the reptilian considered appropriate...and safe.</p><p>The knowledge that Theophilus, Rayner and Sholto were not free to have their children openly and in safety had the big male growling angrily. He wanted to crush their nemesis' larynx, tear out his spine, rip his intestines from the still living body and he had no cares as to how primitive or bloodthirsty those thoughts were. His mate and child had been threatened as had those he loved and protected. Any PrideHomer, aware of the invoked Bloodfeud, who came across Hiram would run him down and rend him apart.</p><p>He pushed the thoughts from his mind as Sholto shifted restlessly as if aware of the direction of Uist's thoughts. He nuzzled lovingly, purring to settle his mate. He lifted the hand Sholto had possessively on his breast and kissed the palm before replacing it. He smiled as Sholto settled. He let his own hand cover his lover's pregnant swell, grinning as his child seemed to know and moved beneath it. There were few placed he felt truly safe but at that moment, his lover in his arms and his child shifting beneath his hand, he was at peace.</p><p>****</p><p>On a nest of thick towels and sumptuous pillows, Theophilus lay on his back as Xavier pleasured him. The reptilian's long tongue slithered over his swell, along his sensitive inner thighs, over his sac and from root to tip and back along his erection. The tip of his husband's tail teased along his shadowed declivity but did not try and penetrate.</p><p>"Close, my husband, so close," he moaned softly, reaching to caress his lover's lilac frill.</p><p>A gentle pinch to a swollen pink bud as Xavier's tongue probed at his slit and Theophilus cried out his mate's name as he reached his zenith.</p><p>Xavier was not surprised that despite his climax, Theophilus did not ejaculate. His precious mate was too close to birthing. It would only be after his body had recovered that he would start producing his seed once again. The lizard was filled with a mix of anticipation and apprehension. Although they had a name, their adversary was still an unknown quantity.</p><p>He moved to kiss his lover as Theophilus finally recovered from his climax. His tongue flicked in and out of Theophilus willing mouth, the blond stroking at Xavier's smooth skin.</p><p>"Thank you," Theophilus whispered, already he was finding it difficult to keep awake. As much as he loved carrying Xavier's child, he hated the debilitation that pregnancy brought with it.</p><p>The lizard gazed tenderly at his beloved. Theophilus tried so hard to keep going even when his body protested. The Dregan had been particularly active in helping to nurse Alden following the beast-man's bouts of surgery. Xavier had deemed it less stressful to let his mate be a participant in Alden's care than for the blond to be worried.</p><p>To everyone's delight Alden had come through his initial recovery from injury exceptionally well and through a couple of further bouts of surgery intended to work on replacing his destroyed eye and facilitate better speech.</p><p>"Sleep, my heart," Xavier whispered. "I will be here to watch over you."</p><p>He tenderly covered the already drowsing blond with a large, soft sheet and sat at his mate's side. He was worried, as were Uist and Tristam. He was also angry that the happiest time of their lives was being tainted. He felt Hiram knew too much about Tristam, even for a man of his wealth. He prayed that their defences were sufficient to protect their vulnerable ones from him.</p><p>A noise had him instantly on his feet. He relaxed as he saw Rayner, wearing just a loose shift, with Tristam behind him.</p><p>"May I stay with you and Theophilus?" the brunette asked. "Tristam wants to relieve Uist and I'm too tired to sit up with him."</p><p>"Rayner?" Theophilus opened sleepy, golden orbs and then raised an arm in invitation.</p><p>With a little assistance, Rayner was manoeuvred to lie alongside the blond, both younger males asleep in seconds.</p><p>"He will be fine here, my brother," Xavier assured.</p><p>****</p><p>Uist was grateful to Tristam for giving him time to be alone with his mate. Sholto was now lying on their bed, his legs spread wide, his erection hard and leaking. Uist knelt alongside the supine form, his tongue licking every precious inch of his mate's skin. Uist's lips mated with his lover's, no longer gentle and tender, but searing and passionate. Uist then moved his kisses down Sholto's jaw and to his neck, sucking and biting lightly. As he traversed his lover's skin, he heard Sholto cry out softly at a harder bite between his neck and collarbone, but Uist soothed away the hurt with a laving tongue and a swirling lick.</p><p>"Mine," the cat-man growled, needing to mark his mate.</p><p>"Yours, Uist, yours, yours," Sholto moaned.</p><p>Uist moved on to the furred chest, pressing moist kisses across Sholto's breast. He suddenly sucked a nipple into his mouth, his tongue playing over the peak.</p><p>"Oh, please," Sholto gasped, hips jerking up involuntarily. White-hot fire shot straight to his groin, his already rock-hard erection oozing tear after tear of need. In response the big male bathed his nipple in small kitten licks, his fingers pinching and tweaking the other one making Sholto twitch and moan. Sholto's hands ran through Uist's hair, feeling its texture and petting his lover as well as holding him to his chest. Uist knew how sensitive his nipples were.</p><p>Sholto let his eyes fall shut as Uist switched to the other nub, suckling it as his fingers teased the one previously in his mouth. Sholto was certain he was on fire. Uist's licks and nips were slowly and incrementally stoking the inferno of love and desire that was consuming him. His shaft was begging for contact, silver trails glistened in the thick pelt of pubic hair and his lightly furred abdomen. Sholto let his hips rise and fall, whimpering softy, and rocked his head from side to side.<br/></p>Uist revelled in making his mate come undone at his touches. He lapped at Sholto's heated skin, its fine sheen of perspiration adding an extra saltiness to the taste. He laved the cinnamon nubs into hard peaks, nipping carefully to mewls of delight. He could scent Sholto's increasing arousal and the glittering silver contrasting with crisp, dark hair, beckoned silently. He licked around the base of Sholto's engorged flesh and the decorated abdomen.Certain his mate was at the limit of his endurance, he engulfed the straining penis to the root and pressed the tip of his finger against his lover's tightly furled flesh. A wail of completion accompanied the outpouring of Sholto's nectar and Uist drank greedily, massaging the younger man's sac to milk him fully. As he swallowed the last drop of the salty-sweet elixir, Uist knelt up, pumping roughly at his own damson-hued flesh. He roared his release, anointing Sholto's still flushed chest. Breathing harshly in the aftermath, Uist rubbed his crème into his mate's skin and inhaled deeply. A heady scent of satiation, sweat and their joint releases washed over him and he purred contentedly."Possessive, love?" Sholto muttered drowsily, knowing the answer already."Of you? Always, my own," Uist replied honestly. He stretched lazily to lie alongside his lover, running a finger over the furred chest and circling the dusky nipples. He captured Sholto's reddened lips with his own and let his tongue sweep imperiously into the willing mouth. As he pulled back he tenderly stroked Sholto's face, the younger man angling into the loving caress. "You need to sleep," Uist rumbled, seeing the smudges under Sholto's eyes. "Would you be willing to join Rayner with Theophilus and Xavier?""You wanna sit with Tristam?" Sholto murmured, post-orgasmic lethargy enveloping him."I do not want any one of our family alone at present, even here on 'Silver'.""I understand, lover," Sholto replied, nuzzling into his big mate.****Xavier glanced up to see Uist striding towards him, a sleeping Sholto in his arms. The reptilian smiled and pulled back the sheet on the free side of his young husband.As Uist lay his precious bundle down, Theophilus instinctively encircled the darker male with an arm and Sholto burrowed as close as he could get. The cat-man smiled tenderly at the three sleeping men."They are so fragile, so vulnerable and yet so strong and so brave," he said to Xavier. "His time is very near," he added as he touched Theophilus' hair with a barely-there caress."I can do little to help him in the actual birthing," Xavier sighed. Nanobots would try and stop his body performing as it needs, but I can step in once our child is delivered and ensure that for the next time I can help more.""We will all help him when his time comes," Uist said determinedly as he stood. "I will sit with Tristam. If you need anything, call us."****The six men headed from 'Silver' to the house of Jameson and Aurora. It saddened them to see the level of security at the place they regarded as their home. A mixture of electronic systems as well as personnel made it seem cold and impersonal rather than inviting and homely. They were met at the door by the older couple, Aurora whisking away her 'boys' to settle and fuss over, whilst Jameson indicated Tristam, Xavier and Uist should accompany him into his den."Willis has been in touch," he said. "It seems Tristam's little chat has caused long-reaching ripples. It's still very low-key, but it's there."They looked up as another PrideHomer entered and instantly Uist strode over to him, the two males rubbing their faces in greeting."This is Denys," Uist said, initialling the formal greeting. "He is my sire's younger sibling.""He has offered to be part of your personal security, boys," Jameson explained"I have brought my sons, Jaymz and Dayd," the big male rasped. Taller and broader than Uist with caramel fur, he stepped up to personally greet Tristam and Xavier. After rubbing faces he clasped Xavier's shoulder. "The Pride looks forward to their newest member's safe deliverance and I to my first great nephew.""Thank you, Denys," Xavier nodded his gratitude. "I cannot express how grateful I am to all who have stepped forward to help protect us or find our nemesis.""He will soon be no threat. I swear it," Denys growled.****Tristam accompanied Uist and Jameson to Elite HQ wanting to personally review all the information they had. Jameson's internal security investigation had uncovered only two rogue Elite personnel, which included Theophilus' abductor. Tristam intended to go through everything Jameson had. A couple of hours of intense study later and Tristam needed to take a break.He stared at his reflection in the washroom, seeing the toll that the recent events had taken on him. He gave a mental sigh. Soon it would be over. He glanced up at the overall-encased engineer who nodded at him as he headed to a cubicle.As Tristam moved to leave, the engineer raised his hand, discharging a small needle from the device on his wrist. He grinned coldly at the fallen blond. Stepping past the unconscious man, he pulled the specially-modified trolley into the room and removed a shallow shelf of tools. It concealed a large empty space that he carelessly bundled Tristam into. Whistling jauntily, he replaced the false top and wheeled his prize away.****Tristam woke, letting himself come to full consciousness slowly. He listened carefully and scented as unobtrusively as possible. Neither sense told him anything much. The room smelt of antiseptic and there was no one else in there. He slitted an eye open and used his enhanced vision to scan the room. It was empty and sterile. From his perspective he could see the chemical toilet and washbasin. He had been stripped and dressed in a mid-thigh shift that was cold and stiff against his skin and could feel a metallic collar around his neck.There was nothing more he could tell and he gave a mental shrug. He stretched theatrically, noting that there were no windows in the room. The door was clearly electronic and slid open and shut leaving only a tell-tale line down what would otherwise appear to be a wall. Once demonstrating awareness, he was sure he would not have long to wait for attention."How nice to see you again, Tristam," Jabez smiled maliciously from just inside the door that slid silently open and closed. "If you're contemplating escape, don't bother. The doors all operate on biochip technology. No chip, no open.""I understand," Tristam said. At that moment, escape was not his concern. He had the feeling that Jabez was more involved than they had first surmised, but of paramount importance was finding the man responsible for their recent trials. He stood and took a step towards his smirking captor before his body was suddenly flooded with excruciating pain. He dropped to his knees trying to breathe around the waves of agony."Just a taste, Tristam," Jabez said. He caught a handful of the blond's hair and pulled the other man's head back, slowly rubbing his clothed erection across Tristam's face. "The only reason I haven't already taken you is that my scientists need a base-line before they begin testing you in earnest. Once the drugs are fully out of your system and they complete their first run of sampling, I will have you."Tristam did not waste energy responding to the threat. The pain had come as a shock to his system and now he knew exactly the function of the collar he wore. Although it symbolised Jabez's dominance over him, it was also the way in which his punishment was administered. He could still feel the tingle around his throat as he got slowly to his feet. As bad as it had been, he let Jabez think him more shaken than he was.At that moment, it was possibly the only physical advantage he had. Keeping his head bowed, he used the periphery of his vision to regard the man who leant carelessly against the wall, a small device glinting in one hand whilst the other traced the outline of his straining shaft.He mentally prepared himself as Jabez casually pushed away from the wall and over to him. He kept his face neutral as he was backed against a wall. He made no attempt to resist or avoid unwanted touches as Jabez's free hand slid beneath the shift to pinch at his nipples, feel his disinterested sex and then begin a slow squeeze of his sac. He gave a grunt of pain at a hard squeeze that coincided with Jabez's mouth closing over his. He held himself rigid as an unwelcome tongue snaked into his mouth. The display of power seemed to appease the silver-haired man and Tristam glowered menacingly after him as he sauntered towards the door."I think I will have your nipples pierced," Jabez said laconically. "I can hang weights from them when I bend you forward and take you from behind. I'm looking forward to all the things I can do to you," he added in a menacing tone. "This way."Tristam was ushered ahead and guided down a windowless corridor. He could feel Jabez's eyes on him, but refused to allow himself to become unnerved. They had known the danger of retaliation when they had openly challenged Hiram. He was alive, well, about to meet their nemesis and, for the moment, that was the most he could have hoped for.A door opened ahead and he walked inside. It was a Spartan room with sterile white walls. The only furniture was a table and a couple of large, heavily padded chairs in the same chilled white. One wall was covered with a white blind, drawn against the view of the outside world. Tristam stopped, waiting for Jabez as the smirking man strode past heading towards the blind."Come here," he commanded arrogantly.Tristam ambled slowly towards him as, with a theatrical flourish, Jabez changed the blind from opaque to transparent. Tristam stared at the vista before him."That's right, Tristam," Jabez's voice came from behind him. "It's a sight you know so well. We're no more than fifteen minutes away from Elite HQ, across the park. Someone once said the best place to hide something was in full view. You know this as the Pharmaceutical Development Corporation that works hand-in-glove with both the Military and the Elite. Of course, my more...alternative...uses for it are conducted well below ground level. Now for the next part of your surprise."Tristam watched as Jabez moved closer to the left-hand wall and waved his hand to open another door. He vanished inside, only to emerge after a moment guiding an electronic wheelchair in which sat a frail, aged figure."You wanted Hiram, Tristam," Jabez said mockingly. "So here he is. Hiram III, third generation clone. What the original Hiram couldn't know was that by taking cells from each successive clone was the equivalent of old-fashioned photocopying. Any imperfections in the original are magnified in the copy. Hiram had congenital eye defects and muscle wastage which became apparent and debilitating earlier with each copy. It's not worth using nanobots on him, they have to work round the clock and he no longer goes out in public. My father effectively ran the company during the latter years of Hiram II and now it's my turn.""How aware is he?" Tristam asked."Who cares?" Jabez laughed. "I make the credits and any illegal activity uncovered sits on his shoulders. The perfect arrangement. You brought your own damnation down on your head after you closed down so much of the company. I looked at everything to do with you to get my revenge."Watching the silver-haired man, Tristam realised that as physically deficient as Hiram was, Jabez's mind was equally unstable. He had singled out Tristam for all his hatred. At the very least it was likely that Jabez was psychotic. For the blond that meant he was more dangerous than anticipated. There was no way of knowing just how far Jabez would go and it was obvious he was completely fixated on his revenge."Some information was easy to come by," Jabez continued. "Some took cunning and great amounts of credits. Imagine my delight to eventually find that you were one of the Corporation's early experiments. Sight and hearing successfully enhanced through genetic engineering with PrideHomer DNA and the only survivor not psychotic like Regina became or reduced to a vegetative state. Your lab was intended to create the perfect covert, surveillance operative. Just like the Beast was designed to be the perfect foot soldier. The experiment was deemed a failure after your Lab was found and closed down. There was never any indication your genetic advantage had remained. However, we will gain much from studying you."He laughed. The sound was cold and menacing."Hiram was never your nemesis. It was always me."Swallowing past a dry throat, Tristam could scarcely believe what he was hearing. This was the origin of his existence. He pushed it aside. It did not matter. He had become who and what he was due to the love and care of Aurora and Jameson and his beloved Rayner."You," Tristam growled, forcing himself to remain calm. This was still not the time to react. "You were on the space station that held Uist, Sholto and Theophilus? You were the one who terrorised two pregnant members of my family.""Fortunately not." Jabez shuddered as he remembered the destruction of his station. "The images were being broadcast to me. It was not a place I chose to visit in person. Once they had birthed, I would have had Theophilus and Sholto moved. Uist would have remained to supply me with PrideHomer DNA. I will still have the Dregan," Jabez continued, his voice dropping in timbre."Never," Tristam hissed. The feral smile and less-than-sane glint in Jabez eyes had a cold fission tingle down his spine."I will let the lizard live with the loss of his husband and child, that will be sufficient suffering for him. Rayner and your child can also live. After all, you will be more pliant if they remain free, their freedom for your submission. Although who knows what I may gain from studying your offspring? That may be something for the future," Jabez said, almost rambling now he was putting his thoughts into words. "I still want Sholto and his child, a natural human-PrideHomer hybrid, although I will probably need to kill Uist to have him. And of course, the Dregan will refuse me nothing for the sake of his 'family' and his baby; he will be the perfect, malleable bed-mate for me."Tristam looked at Jabez barely able to believe what the man was saying. Even if Bloodfeud had not been invoked, there would be no way Tristam would let him live after voicing his depraved desires. When he had begun speaking of Theophilus, Tristam's nostrils had been assailed by the stench of the silver-haired man's lust. His eyes narrowed. Jabez was a walking, talking, dead man."Anyway, enough for now. Enjoy some time with the man on whom you invoked Bloodfeud. He may even be coherent for a few minutes," Jabez added with a cruel laugh.Tristam looked at the man in the chair who peered myopically at him. He was not even sure Hiram understood what was happening in the room, much less any wider issues. He sighed. Hiram was probably more of a prisoner that he was. It was with some surprise that he realised the older man was motioning him to come closer. He moved to kneel at the side of the chair."You need this." The voice was barely above a dry husk and a bony, shaking finger tapped at a small chip visible under the translucent skin of Hiram's right wrist. "No use to me," he continued. "I can open the door but then what? Jabez stopped the elevator coming to this floor and I can't crawl down the stairs.""You seem very lucid," Tristam observed, looking into the rheumy, grey eyes behind thick lenses."I'm not as mentally impaired as I let Jabez think. I share my originator's desire to live, even in this state. By the time I realised my physical predicament it was already too late. Poetic justice, don't you think? I front the legitimate side of an organisation that, behind closed doors, seeks to manipulate genetics. For all the technology available, it can do nothing to help me. My body dies a little each day for all the credits in the bank and all the scientists at Jabez's disposal.""You were never involved yourself?" Tristam clarified."Jabez only enlightened me after the court trial. My memory chip only contains memories of the charitable work the organisation does. Or at least used to do. Offsetting profits made selling defence and military armaments against subsidising wells and irrigation systems and such like. We're wasting time. In the bathroom is a supply of nanobots. Guide me over and let's get this chip out."****Jabez returned to see both men sitting silently, side-by-side staring at the view from the window. He gave a cold smile of satisfaction. Firstly Tristam, then the Dregan and his child and finally Sholto and his, his plans were still on track and he would bend Tristam to his will."Time's up, Tristam," he said. "Back to your room."Tristam obeyed wordlessly. Once back in his cell, Jabez halted him with a hand on his shoulder."Touch me," he growled.Tristam locked eyes with Jabez as his hand slid over the unmistakable bulge at the other man's groin. Then he squeezed hard. The waves of agony crashing over him within seconds were expected and deemed worthwhile."I'm glad to see you still have some fight left in you, Tristam," Jabez said in a strained voice, his hand gripping the device that activated the blond's obedience collar so hard that his knuckles were white. "You'll pay for that little display later."Tristam crawled to the bed and pulled himself onto it. Hiding his face in the crook of his elbow, the blond smiled, clenching a fist tightly around the small chip. Even without the means of escaping the cell, Tristam would still smile. Since he had first awakened, he had felt the comforting touch of his husband's mind. His kidnapping was not only expected, but hoped for. Things would happen very quickly. Jabez was going down.Hard.****It seemed like no time at all before Tristam surged to his feet and opened the door to race into the corridor. He could feel Rayner was still a distance away, but closer, and gave a grim smile, knowing his husband would have refused to stay at home. Neither Sholto nor Theophilus would be present and he was grateful his lover was not going to actually enter the premises.Remembering the atrocities described to him by Uist that he, Sholto and Theophilus had witnessed, he wanted to spare Rayner any chance of being exposed to anything similar Jabez might have lurking in the deeper parts of the building. Before he could reach Hiram's suite, Xavier and Uist appeared. Tristam gave a curt nod at the raised eyebrow of the cat-man."I'm fine. Our nemesis is Jabez not Hiram. I'll explain as we go."The fighting was minimal, Elite forces storming the building in numbers and securing it swiftly with no loss of life on their side. However, Tristam, Uist and Xavier began to get more agitated as no sign of Jabez was uncovered. Tristam suddenly came to abrupt halt, his eyes focused on a distance none but he could see. With horrified eyes, he turned to the other men."Theophilus," he whispered.****The uniformed Elite officer strode purposefully into the home of Jameson and Aurora, using an electronic card to enter the grounds. He presented the card inside the house and whispered into the ear of one of the other Elite present. The newcomer gave a curt nod at the reply and headed to the rear of the house. Glancing around, he opened the specified door closing it behind him.Theophilus and Sholto looked over in surprise. They were sharing a sumptuous, red, two-seater sofa in Jameson's library. Theophilus' head rested on Sholto's shoulder as the younger man read aloud from a large book.<br/>"Is something wrong?" Theophilus asked."Not at all, pretty Dregan."At the sound of the voice, Theophilus sat up quickly, staring at the man before them. He felt Sholto stiffen, both recognising the detested tones."You," the auburn-haired man whispered. "From the space-station.""No talking," was the terse response as a gun was pulled out. He removed his headgear, letting the young males see his silver hair and grinned at their wide-eyed looks of shock. "This is a disruptor. It doesn't normally kill, but I'm sure neither of you would like to find out firsthand what happens if it discharges close to your precious babies." Jabez's grin widened at the twin gasps of fear. "I'm only sorry I can take just one of you with me and, of course, that will be you, pretty Dregan.""You will not harm Sholto?" Theophilus queried, moving slowly at the insistent motion of Jabez's gun."I want him to tell everyone just who has taken you. As long as he stays quiet and you docile, there will be no problem. If he tries to raise the alarm or you resist, I'll send a full discharge into your belly," Jabez said threateningly.Theophilus moved slowly to reach Jabez, ignoring the look of triumph in the hard green eyes. As he came to stand by the white-haired man, the sound of an unearthly shriek seemed to vibrate the air around them. The noise startled Jabez and Theophilus moved swiftly. He caught the wrist holding the disruptor and twisted with all his considerable strength. The sound of bone snapping coincided with a bellow of pain and the gun dropping to the floor.Simultaneously the door flew open. Theophilus was suddenly enveloped in strong PrideHomer arms and carried rapidly from the room. Glancing up from the chest of Denys, he saw Sholto in Willis' embrace and sagged with relief. He tried to ignore the screaming from the library, burying his face back into Denys' chest, grateful for the deep reverberating purrs that helped drown out the other sounds.A moment later a familiar figure limped from the library as Theophilus and Sholto were carefully lowered to stand shakily amongst their extended family."He will trouble us no more," came the rasping voice."You have our thanks, Alden," Willis said, looking from his son's pale-faced, young husband to the other male and then to Theophilus.Alden moved to gently touch each of the pregnant men, as if making sure for himself they were safe."We are well," Theophilus confirmed. "You felt me?" he asked, tilting his head."Yes. Fear, shock, and a cry for help," Alden nodded. "The link strengthens."Theophilus and Sholto were guided into Jameson's den. Denys' son Dayd, a PrideHome physician, adamantly insisted on checking each in turn to ensure they had suffered no ill effects. At the conclusion of his examination, Aurora appeared with steaming mugs of hot chocolate, a craving that all had developed in the last stages of their pregnancies. The two men looked up at the sounds of activity outside the den.Uist and Xavier raced into the house, looking around as if expecting to see bedlam and bloodshed. They relaxed a little at the sight of Willis, smiling as he approached them."Tristam and Rayner follow," Uist said tersely. "They have said everything is now well?" Uist could not help but turn the statement into a question."All is well," Willis confirmed. "Alden understood Theophilus' call for help and has taken care of the one who would harm them." Willis' eyebrows rose at the savage snarl from his son. "He was the one we sought?" the older PrideHomer asked."Perhaps it is fitting that Jabez was killed by one of those he created," Uist growled, warring with himself over relief Jabez was no longer a threat and regret he was not able to kill the man personally. "Our husbands?" he asked his sire, deciding relief was the victor. He just wanted to have his mate in his arms."This way," Willis said.By the time Tristam and Rayner made their way into the house, Uist and Xavier were each looking after their mates and other family members milled around, fussing over the small group."You felt me, too?" Theophilus asked, his voice almost child-like with awe, from the shelter of Xavier's embrace."We did, beautiful," Tristam smiled. "Both of us picked up your fear and subsequent relief. Tymon's lessons have paid dividends with your nascent psychic abilities. Hiram was not the one we sought," he affirmed. "Jabez was the orchestrator of our troubles. I understand from Denys that Alden has taken care of the danger.""He heard my call for help," Theophilus nodded. "We are safe now?" he asked, his voice tinged with hope."Let us complete the clean-up operation, beautiful," Tristam smiled. "I want to make completely certain."****Tristam lay on his side on the bed, his lover facing towards him. He gave a soft moan as Rayner nursed first one then the other nipple into peaked, fiery nubs. The moan deepened in timbre as open-mouthed kisses bathed his chest and abdomen. Soft lips encircled his aching shaft and he gave a guttural groan as his straining erection was enveloped in wet heat and insistent suction.A talented tongue lovingly lapped at the head of his penis, worshipping it with tiny kitten licks before he was taken deeper once more. A gentle hand found his sac, rolling the precious orbs inside, whilst the other worked his shaft in tandem with unrelenting sucking and waves of mental pleasure that ebbed and flowed. He gave a soft whine of disappointment as his erection was released."I want you in me," Rayner husked.The sound of his mate's voice and the pheromones pouring off the younger man left Tristam in no doubt of Rayner's sincerity. He knew it was what he wanted...needed, but was afraid of hurting his lover. It had been some time since Rayner could comfortably accept him and his pregnancy was even more advanced."Rayner..." he began, but was silenced by soft lips on his."We both need this and I know you won't hurt me." With slow, careful moves, Rayner turned to press his buttocks against Tristam's hard flesh. "If it becomes too uncomfortable you will know," Rayner assured. "Trust your instincts the way I do, love," he added.Tristam fussed with the pillows and smiled as he nuzzled Rayner and then spooned up behind him. He picked up their oil, anointing his fingers to movie them with care inside his lover as he sucked and nipped lightly at Rayner's earlobe. His husband's shaft hardened rapidly at the way Tristam masterfully played with his body, hitting all his young lover's hot spots. Then Tristam was ready to enter his mate's glistening portal."If it becomes too much, tell me," he growled. "You won't be able to hide it and I want to give you only pleasure.""In me. Now," Rayner demanded softly. Tristam's hard flesh pushed into him with an aching slowness. He moaned again, collapsing back against his lover, letting his pleasure flow into his mate's mind, spiraling them both towards a shared zenith. He felt more full than ever before, but the pleasure was all-encompassing, chasing away anything other than the perfection of their union."That's it, angel, let me take care of you. I've got you and I'm never letting you go." Tristam penetrated as deep as he could due to his mate's condition and he murmured his loving words into a small ear, chasing them with his tongue.Rayner shuddered at the deep, almost guttural sound of Tristam's voice and then moaned softly at the slick muscle that slid in his ear, sliding around before teeth once more nibbled at his lobe. Rayner's hand clenched Tristam's hip tightly. He could not speak, he was too aroused. Instead he focused on flooding Tristam's mind with the joy and delights the lovemaking engendered. In response his lover began to move slowly and gently, thrusting shallowly in and out at a leisurely pace."You feel so good," Tristam groaned. "So perfect, Rayner, so very, very beautiful."Rayner felt the strain in his lover's body as Tristam refused to speed up or push deeper. Then Tristam's hand wrapped around his throbbing shaft and Rayner lost his tenuous control in three, almost-too-soft caresses. He cried out his climax, his release pouring into Tristam's care.Tristam rotated his hips, giving a final thrust and spilled his seed, filling Rayner with his come. He gave a muted shout of his husband's name before burying his face in Rayner's soft, sweet-smelling tresses.The blond kissed the nape of his lover's neck, nipping and sucking as he recovered from his high. He tended to his mate as soon as possible, sliding an arm under Rayner's head as support and the other possessively around his waist to rest on the brunette's swell. Smiling with the same contentment that he could feel from the precious man in his arms, Tristam nuzzled affectionately, kissing the bare shoulder and neck, scenting and tasting joy, satiation and completion.****Xavier hid a sigh, knowing that the pinkish tinge to his frill was a giveaway to his true feelings. He stood in the sitting room of Jameson's house and looked around at his extended and diverse family. His husband sat huddled close to Uist, the cat-man holding tightly with one arm to the blond and with the other to his mate on the large settee. Tristam and Rayner sat nearby with Jameson and Aurora hovering beside them.His parents, Laban and Vira and brothers Ivo, Asa and Yve were now present, due to Theophilus' imminent birthing. His cousin Meta stood with Alden. The genetically created man had made his home on Phixia and Xavier was pleased to see them so openly a couple. Willis and Steffen stood by Uist and beside them Denys, his wife Jaen as well as sons Jaymz and Dayd.Further back were the Aantnaa friends of Sholto, consisting of two workers and two soldiers, the insectile types as different from each other as human was to PrideHomer. Darius was also there, both as friend and as Elite security. Tymon stood in the furthest corner, his cloak wrapped around him like a shield."My family, my friends," Xavier finally spoke, drawing all eyes to him. "I am pleased to see you all here and sorry that the news I have for you is not what I would have wished it to be." He glanced briefly at Jameson, Tristam and Uist. Only the four of them knew what he was going to say and he could see them tensing. "In deference to a request by Jameson, I undertook to perform the autopsy on Jabez. I regret to inform you that Alden destroyed a clone."A cacophony of sound broke loose; yowls of anger from PrideHomers, howls from Phixians, an ululating shriek from Alden, buzzes from the insect race and cries from humans. Xavier waited a moment watching sadly as Theophilus shrunk closer to Uist. His beloved husband was too attuned to Xavier not to have known he was bearing bad news. The reptilian fully intended to comfort his mate at the earliest opportunity."The clone's memory chip had significant episodes missing that meant it was not the orchestrator of any of our recent trials. The real Jabez used one of the hidden exits from the building when we stormed it, activating the clone with the sole purpose of trying to snatch Theophilus. Jabez then went straight to the space port. The memory chip recorded that the clone had just twenty minutes to get Theophilus to the space port to travel with the real Jabez or the clone would have to secure another ship. Jabez was more interested in saving himself, but clearly would not let pass an opportunity to strike at us even as we thought we had brought his danger to an end.""From my time with him, I believe Jabez to be psychotic and psychopathic. His revenge is constantly in the forefront of his mind," Tristam said quietly. "He is a very dangerous individual who will clearly stop at nothing to attain what he wants. We will need to be vigilant until we can track him down and eliminate the threat he poses.""He will not hide from us," Willis growled, the sound menacing and deadly. "He will be found and Bloodfeud will ensure he does not escape justice.""I have some investigations that I think will soon bear fruit," the mental voice resonated in everyone's mind as Tymon strode to stand alongside Xavier. "There are many, gifted to greater or lesser extents, that live anonymously within the larger universe on whom I have called for help.""My own enquiries did not stop with the name of Hiram," Willis rumbled. "I will still work in harmony with Laban and Jameson. There will be no place he can hide."Xavier moved to envelop his husband in a tight embrace. He was aware of Rayner and Tristam coming to join them as well as Uist and Sholto, the six combining as one. The rest of their family moved to surround them. To the reptilian, the love and protectiveness he could feel was solid, strengthening, an almost physical entity.He nuzzled at Theophilus as his husband pressed a loving kiss to his frill. Love and faith shone in the golden orbs and Xavier knew he, like all his extended and diverse family, would do anything to protect Theophilus and the others.Jabez would be found, of that the Phixian had no doubts, and the danger he represented would be eliminated.There could be no peace for them until it was.

<p><b>Silver 9 Retribution</b></p><p>Pelaam© August 2008</p><p>Willis gave a soft smile as the blond wandered almost aimlessly towards him. The golden eyes were slightly unfocused and a cushion was clutched tightly against Theophilus' stomach. Willis pulled him close, turning the lithe body so that Theophilus' back pressed tightly to his chest. The blond head that now lay back against his shoulder began nuzzling at the area his scent glands were hidden. He combined releasing his musk with a slow, deep rhythmic purr that reverberated in his chest as he caressed the blond's swell.</p><p>He frowned as he felt the agitation beneath his hand. If the child was moving so much, surely Theophilus must be about to birth. He glanced up as Xavier and Jameson appeared.</p><p>Xavier sighed as he gratefully took charge of his young husband. A soft whine of pain escaping from Theophilus' lips as awareness came into his eyes and he blinked rapidly as Xavier made soothing noises. His beloved mate was so very close, but as yet had not settled to start the process of bringing their child into the world.</p><p>"Sorry," Theophilus whispered. "I do not know how long this will continue."</p><p>"There is nothing to be sorry for, little one," Willis said, cupping the blond's face and kissing the smooth cheek. "Your child will come when ready and we will just have to wait."</p><p>Xavier had found no Dregan medic willing to leave their world to assist with his husband's pregnancy no matter what incentives he offered. All had tried to induce Xavier to return Theophilus from his exile to have his child but the reptilian, and all their family, had been against any such move. All he could gather, after copious payments, was that Theophilus was behaving perfectly normally for a pregnant male and that there was generally little or nothing that medical experts could do to assist birth anyway.</p><p>The nesting instinct, however, was not usual for Dregan males. Many voicing that it was due to Theophilus carrying a half-Phixian child. Creating a safe nest was common for Phixians of both sexes when ready for birth. From the little he had gleaned, the blond's body would know what to do when the baby was ready. He fully intended to record every process so that, for any other child they might have, modern technology could assist. He dare not even offer pain relief for fear of disrupting Theophilus' body's natural behaviour.</p><p>Theophilus was lying longer each time he went into his nesting phase. It meant that friends and family, present for the birth, were milling around in and out of the house along with those specifically designated as security. No one was able to truly settle whilst the blond was still hovering on the cusp. However, no one was complaining, all were anxiously waiting the moment when the baby was ready to enter the world.</p><p>"Come back outside, my heart," Xavier urged. "You seem to prefer the outdoor nests."</p><p>Jameson and Willis watched as the blond was led away by his protective mate.</p><p>"Uist asked me to wait inside," Willis explained to Jameson. "He is certain Sholto will not last full term and does not want his mate to move around unduly. He was therefore torn between the two of them, not happy that Theophilus is still mobile and wandering. He is equally sure however, Theophilus will ultimately select an outside nest and is waiting there. Of course the fact that he is keeping Sholto and Rayner beside him and encouraging Theophilus to lie in the nest they are beside adds weight to that theory," the older PrideHomer laughed.</p><p>"I hate the fact we have to use so much security," Jameson grumbled. "This should be a time of joy."</p><p>"Theophilus is aware of little beyond his imminent giving of birth, my friend," the cat-man said, affectionately taking Jameson's arm and leading him back towards the extensive rear garden. "When he wants comfort he instinctively seeks out those he loves and trusts. There is a small army of guards, but he has gone to none of them. We are the ones whose joy is marred and then only as much as we let it."</p><p>"I wasn't aware Uist thought his child would be early," Jameson added thoughtfully as they stood at the French windows. "I know Tristam has some concerns, his child is also restless and is a couple of months further away from full term than Uist and Sholto's."</p><p>"If you were to ask me," Willis said dropping his voice. "I would say there is a bond between the children yet to be born that is as strong as that their parents share. Theophilus' baby is preparing to enter the world and I believe the others wish to do the same. Tristam and Rayner's child is more telepathic than its parents. Theophilus' empathic abilities developed into an additional basic telepathy, almost by sheer willpower when Tristam was incapacitated, which it is thought he shares with his child."</p><p>"But there is nothing of that kind with Uist and Sholto." Jameson said.</p><p>"Who knows what the brain may become capable of? There are some in my Pride whose mental abilities exceed that of the norm. It is not something we speak of. It is a talent we keep as tightly guarded a secret as that of our Warriors. Whilst Uist is not amongst them and Sholto has shown no such abilities, neither Rayner nor Tristam showed it at an early age as I understand. They needed each other for it to bloom. And here we have two children who seem to have such a talent and so perhaps the third will also be blessed. I would like to think it will be so. Better all three share the gift to some extent. Now go and keep an eye on our beautiful blond. I pray his child comes soon."</p><p>****</p><p>At the same time as Jameson wandered back into the garden, his image was watched by a group of men who had stopped their vehicle where they could covertly view the older man's home.</p><p>"This the place?" a gruff voice asked.</p><p>"So the Boss says," an equally uncouth voice responded. "We snatch the Dregan and his half-breed. This little viewer taps into their security cameras so we can see exactly where he is and when he's whelped. Shame we can't hear what's going on," he added. "I can almost count the credits we could get for the information we could gather from this lot. Boss was disappointed this was only picking up visual, too."</p><p>"I heard there were Aantnaa," another voice offered. "And PrideHomers."</p><p>"Doesn't matter what they are," the second voice scoffed. "The weaponry the Boss has provided will take care of them all. Knock them all senseless whilst we whisk away the prize from under their noses. The Boss must want him badly. It's the best price we've ever been offered for a job and he's supplied the forged security paperwork, the Elite uniforms, the weaponry, this little viewer. Everything we need to breach their security and make our escape. All we have to do is get in there, get the blond and his kid and get out. Easiest credits we've ever earned."</p><p>"He good for the credit, Doane?" the first man asked. "It's a king's ransom."</p><p>"He's already deposited a third, Jaimin. This lot must've cost a fair bit, too. He'll deposit the second third when I call him to say the job's been a success. I get the last on delivery. You men will get to our rendezvous. Me and Liko will make sure we get the boy to the Boss. All we have to do now is wait. Let's move off. There's no need for us to get too close with this little baby," he added smirking as he waved the viewer. "With the credit from this job, we'll live like princes."</p><p>Raucous laughter and coarse words greeted the declaration and the vehicle took up another vantage spot from which to view the house's proceedings.</p><p>****</p><p>Rayner lay on the bed, knees bent and legs spread wide, as Tristam's tongue slowly slid over his skin. Their unborn seemed to be as agitated as Theophilus'. As the blond was yet to fully settle, Xavier had effectively ushered them away to spend some quiet time away from the general melee and possible influences of others' anxiety. From his vantage point, kneeling over Rayner's supine form, his husband was currently lapping diligently at his nipples and Rayner sighed his pleasure. He moaned and arched as best he could as his mate nibbled carefully at the taut nubs. The gentle ebb and flow of their shared pleasure was echoed faintly by the child he carried and he smiled.</p><p>Tristam's tongue was like wet velvet, soft and warm, dipping lower to lave just above his swollen abdomen. Licks became open-mouthed kisses as Tristam traversed his swell. Lower again and Tristam licked his aching shaft that twitched eagerly for the loving caress. Next his testes were given a thorough bathe before each precious orb was rolled carefully in the blond's mouth. Kisses were dropped down the inside of each wide-flung inner thigh, each shin and to each foot.</p><p>"Tristam," Rayner moaned as he wriggled his toes enticingly.</p><p>Tristam gave into his lover's silent request and brought the twitching toes into his mouth and let the taste explode on his tongue. He ran his slick muscle over, then under, the foot at his mercy. He played with the small digits that were now wiggling in his mouth. Suckling slowly, sensuously, he stopped to watch Rayner unhurriedly stroking his arousal.</p><p>"So good, Tristam," Rayner whispered as he clenched and unclenched his toes. "More please," he panted closing his eyes and moving his hand a little faster.</p><p>Tristam groaned at the erotic tableau. Rayner was lost in the intimacy of the act. It had been a while since he had indulged his mate this way. He brought the right foot up letting his thumb stroke a circle on Rayner's inside ankle. He used his other hand to stroke himself to perfectly equal his lover's tempo. Their link allowed him to match Rayner's inexorable ascent to reach his climax. Their shared pleasure was thick and heavy in the air and Tristam's nostrils flared wide as he breathed deeply. The combined scent of love and arousal made his shaft throb and he growled approvingly. His hardness was slick with his leaking juices and he could scent that Rayner's was the same. He licked his lips, his eyes devouring the small foot he held.</p><p>Rayner cried out as Tristam laved a long stripe with his tongue from his heel to the tip of his big toe. He whimpered pleadingly as the digit was then taken into wet heat and sucked to the same rhythm as both men worked their shafts.</p><p>"Oh, Tristam, so close," Rayner moaned, although he knew he did not have to speak. Tristam would know just how close he was from the feeling of elation that was just a heartbeat, a hair's breadth away from consuming them both. His hand was gently batted aside and he groaned low and deep as a strong, masterful hand encircled his hot flesh to stroke. Rayner's hands gripped tightly to the bedding as he was propelled towards a shared zenith.</p><p>"I can't hold back anymore," Tristam panted, his hips involuntarily thrusting up into his hand as he worked his lover's smooth, hard flesh.</p><p>"Don't, love," Rayner whispered. "Come for me, oh, love," Rayner moaned tossing his head back and forth on the pillow. Those words were the last coherent thought that he had before his shaft pulsed freely, covering Tristam's hand and himself.</p><p>As the jet of precious crème poured forth Tristam bit the arch of the foot that was still in his hand and then roared his completion. His seed adorned the satin thigh of his mate. As he began to descend from his orgasmic high, Tristam took the time to lave the spot he had marked so lovingly. He licked his hand and then Rayner's smooth skin, devouring eagerly every drop of their shared passion before stretching cat-like at his lover's side.</p><p>Rayner smiled as he nestled close, certain Tristam was purring just like Uist did when particularly happy. His smiled widened as he felt his child's echo of their shared joy.</p><p>"Good job Tymon has volunteered to each our little one how to use his telepathy responsibly and not invade minds as he grows," Tristam murmured, his own grin matching Rayner's.</p><p>"And how we can shield ourselves when needing privacy," Rayner giggled. The musical sound became a soft moan as Tristam's mouth covered his and a knowing tongue made its home inside his warm depths.</p><p>They lay trading loving kisses and then both jumped, their eyes wide.</p><p>"It's time," Rayner said, his hand covering his swell where his child was moving agitatedly.</p><p>The couple were already dressing as a voice, in a mixture of excitement and apprehension shouted through their door.</p><p>"Theophilus has settled. Hurry."</p><p>****</p><p>Tristam and Rayner hastened to take their place. They found Theophilus in the outside nest that had found most favour with Uist. Rayner smiled at the tableau. The blond was stretched out fully on his back with a sheet covering the lower half of his body. The family patriarchs: Willis, Jameson and Laban all knelt by his feet ready to be the first, other than Xavier himself, to welcome the child into their family. Uist was on Theophilus' right, the blond's hand clasped tightly. Tristam moved to take Theophilus' left and Rayner to kneel alongside Sholto. The auburn-haired young man had Theophilus' head pillowed on his knees and was already dabbing a damp cloth across the blond's brow.</p><p>Rayner noticed that the air was heavy with the scent of PrideHomer musk and low, rhythmic purrs. He glanced down at his brother-of-the-heart. The normally vibrant golden eyes were semi-glazed and he realised that the scent and sound were not simply making the blond more relaxed, but actually slipping him into a semi-sedated state. The PrideHomers selected as security, as well as the guests were contributing to the hypnotic melody. He heard a counter harmony from the Aantnaa who had attuned their own chirrups to a cadence that helped Theophilus.</p><p>"They know, don't they?" Sholto whispered to Rayner as his hand traced over his own swell. "Mine started kicking just before Theophilus stretched out and now he's settled."</p><p>"Same here," Rayner nodded. "Uist and Tristam don't think ours will wait their full terms. I don't either." He felt the love from Tristam reach out to him. He let it fuse with his own for his husband, for his child, for Theophilus and all their so diverse family and sent it to flow gently into the blond's mind. He gave Sholto, Uist and Tristam dazzling grins as Theophilus' hitherto expressionless face relaxed into a soft smile.</p><p>Xavier knelt watching as his beloved husband began the process of birthing and the gentle smile that softened the previously blank face. He glanced briefly at Tristam and Rayner, knowing in some way the smile was in response to them, He had no words to express the gratitude he felt to those of the varied races and families all around them who now actively contributed to make it easier on Theophilus to bring forth their already much-loved child. He swallowed as he saw the thin line of red that began to ooze at the point from where he would deliver their baby. He raised his head.</p><p>"It begins," he announced. All his attention was then rapt on his precious mate, silently praying that all would go well.</p><p>****</p><p>"Whelping time," Doane laughed as he regarded the viewer in his hand. "Nothing worth watching though. Got all the best bits covered," he added to coarse laughter and crude retorts. He looked at the blond that he and his mercenaries were being paid so handsomely to kidnap. Although he would say nothing in the company he was in, he felt a stirring of lust.</p><p>The blond was indeed incredibly beautiful, in face as well as in body, and he could understand his Boss' fascination. However, there was no way he would double-cross his employer. Not to keep the Dregan for himself or to sell him to slavers.</p><p>The man who had selected him and his elite mercenaries had a long reach and no payment would rival that already agreed. A part of him almost felt sympathy for the oblivious male. If he was picking up the kind of credits to snatch Theophilus, his Boss most certainly was not just going to have the blond as an adornment.</p><p>"How much longer?"</p><p>The petulant question roused Doane from his reverie and he blinked at the viewer, angry at being disturbed.</p><p>"Doesn't look like it's quick," he growled. "I'll tell you when."</p><p>****</p><p>Xavier was unaware of the passage of time as he monitored his mate and their child as the birthing continued. He watched in awe as Theophilus' body finally opened enough to allow him access to the baby. The cadence around him seemed to swell to a crescendo as he lifted free the small bundle, still swathed in a protective sac. He tore the gossamer covering away to gaze at the tiny miracle he and Theophilus had created.</p><p>The baby was mammalian in features except for vertically slitted amber eyes and the tail that curled around Xavier's wrist. The skin held the palest of green tints and there was a thick covering of short, platinum-blond hair on the skull. Father and son locked eyes silently for a few seconds and then he threw back his head and bellowed, the sound echoed by his son's wail and the gathered Phixians.</p><p>"Jameson, your grandson," he said, handing the baby to the mature human.</p><p>"Welcome to the family," Jameson husked, earning himself a muted noise from the child in his arms before passing him to Laban. He smiled as the elder Phixian lifted the child high once more to another bellow from the gathered reptilians.</p><p>Willis stared at the young life passed to him from the large, lizard male. Although no bloodline linked them, Willis felt the instinctive protectiveness for a familial cub wash over him. Grandfather and grandson regarded each other silently for a few seconds before the PrideHomer mimicked Laban's actions.</p><p>"Welcome to my Pride, little one," he murmured. "My first grandson," he shouted aloud. Then he and the PrideHomers gave their own roar of welcome. He passed the child to Uist and watched smiling as one-by-one Theophilus' chosen brothers added their personal welcomes before Tristam handed the baby back to Xavier.</p><p>"We have a son, my heart," he whispered tenderly to Theophilus, unsure how aware his husband would be.</p><p>"Son," came the barely there whisper. The dreamy smile widened marginally as the newborn was carefully cradled against his chest. Theophilus felt Tristam and Uist released their holds on his hands as he tried to hold his baby. Theophilus knew it was Uist who was fussing as he felt a cover enfold him to ensure his son remained secure against his heart.</p><p>Xavier let the cat-man arrange the newborn at Theophilus' breast and then instantly reverted from husband to physician. He started by checking that his mate's body was beginning the process of closing over now the child was delivered. He waited for the computer to display the requested information regarding Theophilus' vital statistics to verify his beloved husband was well and healing. He smiled. It would seem that it was going to be a problem-free event.</p><p>He glanced around at the gathered family and friends and then the large marquee that had been set up. Once the welcoming of the infant had finished Jameson and Aurora, in the role of Theophilus' parents, would usher their guests inside. As soon as Theophilus was well enough to be moved, the three days of celebrations, that accompanied a birth of a new PrideHomer or Phixian, could officially begin.</p><p>The reptilian smiled as he saw Jameson glance over at his wife as she wiped away a tear, his hand reaching to his own cheek to find unnoticed wetness. Xavier glanced back to Theophilus then to Jameson, knowing the mature male was waiting for him to conclude the welcoming ritual.</p><p>****</p><p>Doane watched as the big lizard began to reach towards the blond's body. He grinned. All he needed now was to see the blond seemed recovered. His eyes never left the screen, watching intently. Eventually his patience was rewarded.</p><p>"Heads up, boys," he said. "Time to collect our booty."</p><p>He and his six men strode from their vehicle to the gates of Jameson's home. Doane swiped a card and pressed his face against the retinal screen for his eye pattern to be checked and verified. He turned and grinned at his men as the scan checked and the first gate opened. His nodded approvingly as the rest of his men copied his actions and they stood in a specially constructed area between the initial gate and access to the front gardens. Doane took a deep breath as a second gate swung open and an Elite leader stood ready.<br/></p>"Captain Darius, sir," he said, his voice now taking on a false smoothness. "We have been given these orders.""You know what's in here?" Darius asked as he read the sealed paper and then sighed."Yes, sir," Doane replied. "There is an imminent and credible threat. We've been sent as added security. I have another paper to hand personally to Elite Controller Jameson.""This way," Darius nodded.Doane and his men were taken into the house. Doane blinked as a large PrideHomer growled as they passed him."You represent a threat," Darius said apologetically. "He knows you're unscheduled so something's wrong. If you wait here, I'll get Jameson."Doane watched as Darius slipped through the French windows into the garden. He covertly drew out his viewer. It seemed as though the birth was over. The baby was at Theophilus' chest and the big lizard was fussing in some way. The guests had moved to gather in the marquee and so would be easily subdued en masse. Doane grinned. Perfect timing, he thought."Get the grenades ready," he whispered. "Put on the breathing apparatus."Tiny breathing pieces that pinched tight their nostrils and gave them thirty minutes of air were rapidly affixed. Goggles were pulled on next and Doane nodded when he saw his men were ready. Leaving one man to cover their backs at the French windows, he readied the others to enter the gardens. He gave a mental laugh. The grenades were silent and would stun every living creature in the fall-out zone. They'll never know what hit them, he thought smugly.****Jabez ran his hands over the pale back of the blond at his mercy. Manacles at the wrists were joined by strong chain which in its turn was locked to the metal rails that made the bed's headboard. He rammed his length into his captive hard and fast before stopping once more, smiling cruelly. The pained cry of protest was muted. His Pet had learned quickly that loud, vocal pleas for mercy would be met with harsh punishment.His hands slid from the slender hips to the leather straps on the smooth thighs. Chains led from these to the side of the bed, keeping the kneeling figure's legs spread. On the ankles were more manacles matching those on the small wrists, again chained to the bed. He drove back inside the helpless body with feral snaps of his hips. Bending forward, Jabez wrapped a thick chunk of blond hair around his fist to bare the nape of his Pet's neck. He bit down leaving a mark as he undulated his body, smiling at the whimper as he purposely stimulated the blond's prostate."Good boy," he whispered coldly as he reached under the slender hips to pull roughly at the unwilling erection. His shaft jabbed again at the captive's prostrate as he stroked. It was not for any pleasure the blond might take from the act that Jabez ensured he would come, but rather he enjoyed the dominion over them. The power of forcing an unwilling erection, demanding an unwanted climax and then relishing the sensation of the undesired release as the contracting channel milked him of his own orgasm. He made a muted pleasured sound as he felt the tiny ripples in the slick sheath that heralded the blond's imminent crescendo."Come now," he ordered harshly, burying himself to the hilt as he sped up the rough movements of his hand.He threw back his head with a wordless shout of completion as the spasming channel clenched and unclenched around his ready shaft. He released the organ in his hand, using both hands to grip tightly to hips as he tried to shove impossibly deeper into the heated depths of his prisoner as his semen jetted forth. He held still, letting himself catch his breath before pulling from the trembling body.The key to the prisoner's chains was on a necklace around his neck. He released one leg to join each manacle with a short chain that ensured only small steps could be taken. He unfastened the second leg and then the chain leading from the rails to the wrist restraints. He stepped away from the shaking body, nodding approvingly as they remained unmoving. His Pet was a quick learner."Stand. Face me," he ordered. He kept his face neutral as his captive moved shakily, and with difficulty, due to the restrictive chains, to obey him. He gazed dispassionately into fearful, turquoise eyes. Bruising was still visible on the delicately-featured visage and pale, smooth chest from the punishments he had administered and it displeased his more aesthetic nature. However, they would heal and, from the back at least, Jabez could indulge his fantasy that it was Theophilus he had; a fantasy that would soon become reality. It had been because of that likeness that he had snatched the younger man from the spaceport almost as soon as he had set eyes on him."I'm waiting, Pet," he growled."Th...thank you, Master," came the barely audible response."You behaved well," Jabez continued. "You may have five minutes in the bathroom unaccompanied. Make the most of it and do not be late returning here." He watched as the lithe body moved as quickly as the chains would allow. He then used a plush towel to rub at the dampness of his body and pulled on a short dressing gown,Jabez smiled as he looked at his wrist chronometer. Doane had contacted him to say the kidnapping had been a success. Theophilus and his child were on their way to him and would be arriving soon. In the circumstances he could afford to be generous to his Pet. He gave a soft moan at the thought of both blonds pleasuring him. He might never get his hands on the others, but it no longer mattered. Taking Theophilus would be like a never-healing wound festering amongst the remaining group. Next to Xavier, who was of little interest to him, it would hurt Tristam and Uist who would live with the consequences of failing to protect the blond they loved so much.He moved to the built-in wardrobe and quickly checked inside. Cases were ready and there were several boxes stacked neatly. He nodded his approval. Once he had Theophilus he would call one of his most trusted lieutenants, who were still on Earth, to come to him. His Pet would make a credible female and with dark hair, a husband and child at 'her' side, would attract no undue attention. Contact lenses and wigs for Theophilus and himself would then see a 'family' and a 'couple' leaving for his next secure bolt-hole. His Pet would put up no resistance, especially if drugged and Theophilus would no nothing that jeopardised his child's safety.His next bolt-hole would be one that none of his hired mercenaries knew the location of. He had homes, aliases and access to funds dotted across several planets. He was certain he could easily hide, no matter whom or how many looked for him. Whilst he still did not know how Tristam had been found so quickly, he was confident that he was once again one step ahead of the group and their friends. The shuffling of his Pet brought his attention back to the present."On the bed," he commanded. He locked the chain from the headboard back to the one between the wrist manacles, stretching the arms tight over the blond's head. He did the same to the ankle restraints. He freely fondled the helpless body, from face to mid-thigh, to reinforce his dominance and then retrieved a leather ball-gag. He tilted his head at the tears that leaked. "Speak," he snapped."P...please. Hurts," came the whispered reply.Jabez allowed himself to look as if considering the plea. Some of the bruising was still darker around his Pet's jaw and the gag would be painful. Although it would not do to be too generous too soon, the exhilaration of knowing Theophilus was on his way coursed through his veins. He glowered menacingly at the frightened, younger man."If you make any noise whatsoever you will be severely punished. Do you understand?" He got a frantic nod in reply and tossed the gag back into the bedside locker. As he turned away from the bed, he allowed himself a calculating smile. Everything was going to plan and so much more.The safe-house was set in large, well-manicured grounds. The lower floor held only the kitchen and spare rooms Jabez never used. The real beauty was the vast ocean of which the upper floor had perfect views. Jabez sauntered from the bedroom into the opulent lounge, entering through floor-to-ceiling, intricately carved, wooden doors. One of its remaining three walls was entirely glass and had a balcony outside. Three large, sumptuous settees were angled towards the panoramic view. He ran a hand over the back of one. The leather was butter-soft. Jabez looked forward to seeing Theophilus stretched naked on it. The gold would warm the colour of his pale skin and the caramel would contrast with the blond's hair.Whilst the ambient temperature was computer controlled, Jabez had indulged in a large, ornate fireplace and surrounding gilt mantle. The only fire it held was a holographic image, but on dark evenings, specialist lighting threw the room into a myriad of light and shadow just as a real fire would. Above it was an old-fashioned mirror with an antique gilt frame. The same type of frame adorned the two art pieces that tastefully ornamented the remaining wall. The walls were the lightest blush of pink and the luxurious carpet was thick, soft and the same subtle shade as the walls. Jabez enjoyed indulging in having the best of everything around him.He moved to the old-fashioned, wooden bureau beneath the paintings and opened it, running an appreciative eye at the drinks it housed. He poured himself a large measure of amber liqueur and went to the large windows. The sun was setting over the ocean and currently the sea and the sky were a miasma of blue, orange and red. He opened them and stepped onto the balcony. The temperature was warm enough to remain outside as he watched the sun sink lower, adding deeper red to the vista. He would be sorry to give up this safe-house, but he had others just as opulent and in similarly beautiful surroundings. An insistent buzz had him hurrying inside to a communicator."Speak," he rasped."We're nearly there with the merchandise," Doane's voice replied."Show me," Jabez growled. He activated the viewer and grinned as the scared face of Theophilus came into view. "Excellent," he rapped. "Time for delivery?""Less than an hour.""I'll be waiting." Jabez switched off the communicator, swallowing a large mouthful of his drink. "Soon it really will be Theophilus in my bed," he laughed.****A buzz from the front gates told him Doane's car had arrived. A single vehicle passed through as Jabez watched on his security camera. The car had blackened windows to keep prying eyes from seeing his latest acquisition and prevented the unlikely possibility of Theophilus recognising where he had been brought. He hurried from the room, hastening down the ornate, sweeping staircase, barely resisting the impulse to take the steps two at a time.As he reached the imposing, heavy wooden doors, intending to release the lock, he staggered backwards, his eyes bulging with fear. The doors were struck with such force that the lower hinges, despite their strength, buckled and broke to leave them hanging and swinging with protesting groans. Even as Jabez backpedalled, readying to turn and run, two PrideHomers were in the house and he could see Phixians following. Within seconds he was surrounded.Jabez's eyes moved to each of those surrounding him in turn as he tried to compose himself. Of the two PrideHomers, he recognised Denys whose fur rippled as though trying to contain an even larger body. The Phixians were Xavier's two older brothers. There was an Aantnaa soldier whose fearsome mandibles and claws, easily capable of cracking a human skull, clacked ominously in the sudden silence. Finally, at the periphery of his vision, close to the door stood a cloaked figure."What's the meaning of this?" Jabez demanded, opting for attack as his form of defence."You kidnapped my sibling's cub, his pregnant mate and one who is as Uist's brother. You kidnapped Tristam, intending harm to them all, one way or another," Denys growled menacingly."They all live. They are unhurt. I will be found guilty of nothing that warrants more than imprisonment," Jabez replied as scornfully as possible."Bloodfeud was invoked," Denys snarled. "There will be no imprisonment from where you might reach out to harm those I love once again.""You're not thinking straight, Denys," Jabez laughed mockingly. "You have already come across one clone," he continued emphasising the salient word. "How many others are there? Where are they hidden? Only I know. You kill me and they will be activated as I have instructed and I will reach out after death to continue what I started." Jabez was certain he held the upper hand. That no one in the room would act to harm him with the implied threat hanging over Tristam and the others."You are the one not thinking straight," Denys replied. "How do you think we found you? We uncovered your foul plan to kidnap Theophilus and my great-nephew. The images your mercenaries watched occurred four days earlier. All of my family were safely relocated to PrideHome at the time you thought they were taking part at the birthing." Denys allowed himself a grim, mirthless smile at the shock on Jabez's face. "We were ready and waiting for Doane and his men.""They sold me out," Jabez hissed furiously. "They will pay dearly for that.""They had no choice," Denys continued. "They could hide nothing from Tymon. Neither will you. We will know the locations of all your clones and anyone that might try and harm our family.""I'll tell you nothing," Jabez spat venomously."You will tell me all."The voice was deep, resonate and powerful and Jabez heard it not with his ears, but in his mind. His veneer of bravery shattered as he sought out the cloaked figure, his head shaking in denial. The cloak dropped aside. Tymon's large, naked skull and penetrating black eyes were revealed and there was no mistaking the anger or the hatred the telepath felt for him. They were like shards of glass stabbing into Jabez's unprotected mind."You...your kind cannot enter minds without permission," he stuttered."You cared not for the law when you sought to hurt my brother and his mate," Ivo said. His and his brother's frills were raised high and a deep crimson. He drew his lips back, baring his sharp teeth as his tail lashed angrily. "The law will not protect you now."A screaming, thrashing Jabez was dragged easily into the nearest room. As he watched Tymon follow the others, Denys noticed his son's scenting action and copied it. With Jabez gone, he could now detect a second scent. It was faint yet the fear and despair were unmistakable."This way," Dayd said, taking the stairs two at a time. He was aware of his sire just a step or two behind him as he raced up the stairway. An instinct for which he had no name and had not felt before made it imperative he found the source of the distraught scent. He entered a room and stopped and stared.The small, bound figure's hair was similar to Theophilus, but the frightened eyes were the colour of the lake on his Pride's lands. He became aware of Denys urging him forward at the same time as he noticed the blond's nudity."We need to free him, he's terrified." The words registered, but as he moved forward, his father behind him, the chained young man began to thrash and keen."It's alright," Dayd crooned softly, not wanting the chained male to hurt himself. He released his musk, letting a low rhythmic cadence accompany it from deep in his chest. His heart constricted as he got close enough to hear the tiny whispers from the blond which were pleas not to be raped. "It's alright," he repeated. "I am Dayd, a PrideHomer physician. This is Denys, my sire. We will not harm you. We wish to free you. PrideHomers are a people of honour. We do not harm innocents."The two cat-men eased forward slowly, keeping their movements unthreatening as they approached the younger man. Dayd sat carefully beside him, reaching for the chains holding the wrists together and the arms over the blond's head. As he snapped them apart, he heard Denys doing the same to the ankles and legs. As soon as he was freed, Dayd helped the blond to sit, but was unprepared to find himself with the naked young man climbing into his lap, holding him tightly, sobbing desperately. He glanced at his sire for guidance."Let him cry, then assure him of his safety. Put this on him," Denys added, handing over his tunic top which he knew would cover most of the smaller man's body. "I will ensure things go no further until you have him safely outside in the vehicle."Dayd cradled the smaller form, not resisting as the blond burrowed close against him, inadvertently nuzzling against Dayd's scent glands, triggering a stronger musk. The PrideHomer banked down any thoughts other than calming the fragile male and getting him out of the house. He eased the teary visage away from his neck as the sobbing began to abate, smiling encouragingly."Let me help you on with this and we can leave this place," he said softly, helping the slighter form to stand. "You need not fear Jabez. He will never harm you again," Dayd vowed.Once the tunic was on he swept the unresisting form into his arms, surprised when he was clung to with a strength he did not think the smaller man possessed. He tightened his own grip, keeping the slight male close to his body and purring softly which seemed to help keep him reassured. He then hurried to obey his sire. He needed to get his bundle in the vehicle and then he would move the car away from the house. The young man did not need to bear witness to what would happen to Jabez.Denys watched, nodding approvingly as his son came swiftly downstairs, carrying the blond. He waited a moment and then entered the room in which Jabez was being held. The silver-haired man no longer looked arrogant or confident."It is concluded?" Denys queried, his eyes on Tymon."Nothing was hidden from me. We can end this.""Who is going to be brave enough to murder me in cold blood?" Jabez rasped, trying to take back control of the situation. "You are all supposed to be civilised creatures. I'm not armed, not resisting. To kill me is murder.""None of us will touch you," Denys replied. "That will be left to another. One whose claim for retribution outweighs any we have."Jabez looked around in confusion as the others in the room spread apart to leave him isolated. His eyes focused on the door as bestial snarling got progressively louder. He screamed as a creature, large and furred, its claws extended and teeth bared, shoved the door from its hinges. His scream was drowned out at the beast's primal roar as it saw and scented him. His legs refused to obey his mind's order to run. Jabez was still screaming as the first slash of claw eviscerated him. The second brought silence as it severed his jugular vein.The beast ignored the blood that pulsed in weakening jets from the mauled throat and the intestines that slipped from the ravaged bowel. It bellowed its triumph as its large hands fastened around its prey's neck, crashing larynx, oesophagus and cervical bones. It tossed the lifeless body away, throwing back its head and roaring."It is over," Denys said dispassionately. "Bloodfeud has been satisfied. Come, Uist." The older PrideHomer ushered the beast from his world's past back into the hallway. He used towels passed to him by Tymon to wipe away the blood from Uist as his nephew began his transformation from ancient beast to modern-day Warrior."Thank you," Uist panted as he regained his usual form. He nodded his acceptance of assistance as fresh clothing was offered."Wait with Dayd," Denys said. "We need to clean up and will be some time."<br/>Uist stood outside and breathed the clean, fresh air, ridding his scent of the lingering coppery odour of Jabez's blood. A part of his brain had realised that Dayd had someone with him as the PrideHomers had passed. Curiosity now burned in Uist's veins and he hurried to the vehicle. He opened the rear door to find his cousin still cradling a small, blond human on his lap. The interior of the car was heavy with Dayd's slightly sweet musk."Who is he?" Uist asked softly, sitting beside his cousin."I do not know his name as yet. He was too distressed to truly question. It seems Jabez recently kidnapped him, I think because of his resemblance to Theophilus. He was naked and chained to Jabez's bed," Dayd added in a low, feral growl. His face softened instantly at the tiny sound of distress from the man he held and he softly nuzzled the blond's temple. "As a physician I must take care not to confuse gratitude for rescue for something more," he added, looking into Uist's eyes."I think that for once you should let the needs of the man come to the fore. Do not push him away, Dayd. Let him come to terms with what has happened and see what transpires.""I thought to return him home and leave him..."The distressed sound had both PrideHomers releasing their musk to comfort the blond."Take him to PrideHome and let him contact whoever he needs. My sire or yours, or even I will arrange for whatever family he wants to be brought to him," Uist rumbled. "It seems to me that your presence is important to him," he added with a smile.****The barest whisper of his name was breathed across the candlelit room and the sound poured over him like liquid honey, tracing a frisson of passion down his spine. The cat-man stalked to the bed which held his mate. He was going to claim that which was rightfully his.Uist had waited nearly a full month from the birth of their child to share intimacy with Sholto, but had refrained from entering the precious body of his beloved mate. It was now another month later still and at the combination of his lover's insistence, and Xavier's assurance that Sholto was fully healed, he was going to unite them in passion.When he touched the edge of the enormous bed, Uist dropped onto his hands and knees. Never breaking eye contact with Sholto, he crawled forward, watching his mate's eyes darken further with desire. Uist reacted instinctively to the way his lover stretched out, spreading arms and legs open to him.The primitive within the cat-man recognised and accepted the deliberate vulnerability, the conscious submission. Uist, the civilised man, also recognised the act of love and trust. The burning need to join physically with his mate was almost overpowering. His erection, hard and leaking, began to throb in time with his lover's heartbeat.The musky scent of Sholto's desire rose into the air, simultaneously caressing and consuming him. As he crawled up along his mate's supine form, a deep growl began to sound an instinctive warning to others. Uist stopped, poised above his lover and allowed the growl to deepen in timbre and increase in volume.With ancient instincts at the fore, the cat-man glanced around his lair, sight and scent his primary senses in seeking out signs of any challenger. His ears strained for the sounds of any others that might try and usurp his rightful place."No one else is here. No challengers. I'm yours alone."The beloved voice soothed and calmed him. Moving in unison, Sholto turned his head to the side, exposing and offering up his neck to the powerful cat-man and Uist lunged down, teeth bared. With a need to mark his lover, to leave a visual sign of his territory, he bit down on fragile flesh at the exposed neck. He pressed his lips against Sholto's carotid artery, feeling the increase in the smaller man's pulse and sucked hard. He felt blood vessels break to leave visible bruising as he claimed and marked his mate."Mine," he growled possessively."Yours," Sholto whispered submissively. He had waited so long for Uist to take him, his need made him feel as though he would fly apart if Uist was not inside him soon. He moaned and writhed, trying to incite Uist's mating urge, trying to hurry the final union they both needed.Despite his recognition of Sholto's desire, Uist was in no hurry to rush their long-awaited mating. Temporarily soothed by the primal marking, he licked gently at the bruised flesh. The taste of his mate's skin upon his tongue had his weeping erection twitching in pleasure. Pools of pre-come from both shafts glistened on Sholto's furred skin as Uist gazed lovingly at his mate. The younger man's eyes were dilated to almost black with desire and need. Uist gently brushed his lips against Sholto's."More."The soft, sensual whisper was a siren call to mate. Sholto's hands ran along Uist's powerful back, trying to pull him closer. Desire pulsed through Uist's veins and he deepened the kiss. He felt Sholto open wider for him, inviting him in. His tongue thrust greedily to plunder, conquer, and finally mate with that of his lover. Hot, wet and sweet, the taste of his mate rolled over him in erotic waves. When he tried to break away to breathe, Sholto let out a throaty whimper and stretched up seeking and finding the cat-man's lips once more. Uist returned the kiss with equal passion and fervour.Travelling down the smaller man's throat to his chest, Uist left a trail of licks, nips, and kisses in his wake. Sholto moaned in response arching his back and thrusting his hips in a wordless plea. Uist smiled and moved gracefully down the furred body of his beloved, worshipping with his hands and his lips, as far as the navel he teased with his tongue, before ascending once more.He lavished generous attention on the small, cinnamon nipples. Sucking and licking them into hard nubs of excited flesh. He bit down on them gently, Sholto's impassioned bucking and begging furthering Uist's arousal and his desire to pleasure his mate. Sholto's skin seemed to be so hot as to be aflame and Uist was growing intoxicated from the pheromones emanating from the smaller man.He moved lower, spreading his beloved's legs wider and ran his tongue along the crease of thigh and groin and lower still to Sholto's sac. The taste of his mate's musk sent an inferno of desire throughout his body and gave him a shiver of excitement. He could hear breathy murmurs of encouragement escaping through soft, kiss-swollen lips.He buried his nose in the thick, fragrant curls and inhaled deeply to an impassioned cry of his name. The sensual scent of musk and desire flowed over him and he groaned low and deep. With a soft purr of pleasure, he ran his tongue from the base of Sholto's shaft up to the glistening tip. He lovingly swirled his agile muscle around the swollen cockhead and then dipped into the slit to taste liquid yearning.Sholto's taste and scent were so exquisite, so sweet, so addictive, that Uist could spend hours pleasuring them both this way. He wrapped his lips around the shaft of his mate. Slowly, he began to move up and down. He licked along the underside on each stroke and squeezed his lips tight. He loved Sholto with all of the skill and passion he possessed. Refusing to rush, he held down Sholto's hips when the younger man tried to thrust up. He kept his head moving at the same measured, steady pace even when Sholto clutched desperately at his head.Sholto ran his fingers through his big mate's hair, trying and failing to dictate Uist's movements. Then he brushed them gently across his mate's neck, knowing it sent shivers across Uist's skin. The sensation of Uist's lips working his hot, hard flesh had Sholto moaning and writhing in pleasure.All semblance of coherent thought or attempt to hurry Uist was finally lost by the skilful lovemaking of his mate. The long, slow suckling of Sholto's shaft was occasionally supplemented by a hand cupping his sac and gently squeezing the orbs it contained or fingers teasing the sensitive skin of his inner thighs and perineum. Pleasure built on pleasure and Sholto was helpless as the tsunami of his orgasm overwhelmed him."Uist I'm gonna, oh, Uist!" Sholto's cry of his husband's name was simultaneous with his release.The living essence of his mate flooded Uist's mouth. Greedily, the cat-man suckled and swallowed. Taste, texture, scent and sound coalesced into one, sending pleasure reverberating through him. His hand gripped the base of his shaft to stave off the orgasm that would otherwise have been triggered. When he came it would be inside the beautiful body as he took Sholto to a second, shared, climax.With a soft rumbling purr, the cat-man crawled up the body of his smaller mate and, mindful of his greater weight, settled himself carefully upon the boneless form. Sholto's rapid heartbeat thundered in his ears, oceanic orbs opened, heavy-lidded with satiation, and the smile that greeted him was as bright as the sun. Uist looked into his mate's cobalt eyes and was captivated by their beauty and the love they reflected.He leant down to rub his cheek along Sholto's chin and jaw. Reaching one hand up to entangle in the auburn curls Uist kissed Sholto gently. The soft, full lips of his mate caressed his skin then nibbled and sucked on his bottom lip before opening up before Uist's demanding tongue. Uist deepened the kiss, making it more aggressive, demanding and Sholto returned it, matching Uist's passion. Desire and need rose and expanded in both bodies once more."Want you inside me," Sholto said, his voice throaty and demanding. "I'm yours, take me."Desire and want coursed through Uist. A low rumbling growl of passion issued forth once more. Again, the cat-man lunged down, teeth fastening tightly on the tender flesh of the smaller man. His mate groaned wantonly in submissive pleasure under his dominance."Yours oh, Uist, take me, please." Sholto pleaded, writhing once more, trying to spread himself wider to offer himself to his alpha mate.The cat-man gently ran his tongue over bruised flesh; the primal side appeased by the visual mark of possession and the scent, sound and feel of his lover in a near mating-frenzy. The heat of Sholto's skin almost seared his own. He reached for their oil and poured it into his hand. The cool liquid sent another frisson of arousal through the big male. Soon the aching flesh between his legs would be sheathed in tight, slick heat. Reining back the primitive within, he tenderly prepared his love.With first one finger, two, then three, Uist thrust into the blood-hot channel. He could feel muscles stretching and opening for him. Gently Uist twisted his fingers, moving them in and out, spreading them apart, loosening and relaxing. He growled his approval as the younger man moaned and whimpered with need.His mate began writhe, riding his fingers. Uist searched for and found the smaller man's sweet spot. He swirled a finger around it, circling and then rubbed across it once, twice, a third time. Sholto's wail of need was the final catalyst.Uist sank his oil-drenched organ into Sholto's body until they were physically one once more. The cat-man held still, feeling his mate's body relax as it accepted him. Uist began slowly, but both men knew they each needed much, much more. Aflame with desire, mating with Sholto became an erotic blur of sensation.His hips pumped in and out of his beloved, faster and harder. He yowled his joy as Sholto's legs moved to lock at the ankle around his waist and his lover began to meet him thrust for thrust. His flesh constantly rubbed his lover's jewel and Sholto's cries harmonised with Uist's into a melody of love and pleasure. With one final desperate thrust, Uist buried himself as deeply as possible and bit down hard on Sholto's throat. The coppery taste of his lover's blood exploded on his tongue and he came, sending his seed deep inside his mate his hips snapping with animalistic ferocity.Uist's orgasm triggered Sholto's second. His shaft, caught tightly between their sweat-slick bodies, erupted, coating their skin with pulse after pulse of his crème. He was not surprised to hear Uist purring loudly with utter happiness as powerful hips now moved in desultory motions and a warm tongue softly bathed the bruises he knew were displayed on his throat. He smiled in pure joy. He had waited a long time to be so thoroughly taken and he had loved every second.He pulled Uist's face to his and thrust his tongue into his mate's mouth. Now he had been reclaimed, Sholto know he could take some control. He felt Uist carefully withdraw from him and he moaned appreciatively as a talented tongue cleansed his body and his entrance. He smiled as Uist rolled over onto his back and he moved to settled over him, draping his leg and arm across Uist's body and resting his head against Uist's powerful shoulder. He felt post-coital lethargy sweep over him even as they traded kisses."I love you, Uist," he whispered."I love you, mine," Uist rumbled, settling his mate. They had the naming ceremony to attend later and he let his purrs deepen as he released his musk. He was happy to lie and hold Sholto as his mate slept.He had no doubt Tristam and Rayner would also take the opportunity for rest. His child and that of the other couple had both arrived early, both within three weeks of Theophilus' birthing. As a consequence, whilst all three could be named together, Tristam was as protective of and concerned for his mate's health as Uist was of Sholto's.All three cubs would now be with Theophilus and Xavier as the babies rarely seemed to want to be apart. The cat-man smiled widely. The blond was a natural at caring for them, as all had known he would be. He hugged his sleeping mate. He was looking forward to the ceremony and having the children welcomed formally into his Pride.****Dayd smiled at the gasp of appreciation as he took Kasen to the waterfall at his Pride's lake. The spot had been recommended to him enough times by well-meaning family members, including Uist and Theophilus, that he had begun to blush when he mentioned to his sire that he was taking the young human there.Kasen was recovering well from his ordeal at Jabez's hands. However, the PrideHomer hid his sadness that the young human's long blond tresses were now just a short bob. Kasen had cut them within hours of meeting Theophilus for the first time.He sighed softly. Kasen's inability to be anything other than distantly polite, believing his other emotions concealed, to the blond Dayd loved and who was such an integral part of his Pride was still a thorny issue. However, he did not want to dwell on those matters. He wanted to bring joy to the small, human male that he was intending to take as his mate."Would you swim with me?" he asked. He was not surprised at the husk quality of his voice and smiled reassuringly at the blush on Kasen's delighted visage."I don't have swimming briefs," Kasen replied, a tinge of hope colouring his words. He had been attracted to, and felt safe with, Dayd from the moment the caramel and chocolate furred male had rescued him. He had been lovingly cared for and allowed to decide for himself the direction his feelings would take. He knew they had only strengthened.He had slept with Dayd every night since his rescue but, although they had indulged in some very light touching through night clothes, Dayd had been adamant on one point. If they progressed to making love then, as far as Dayd and his people were concerned, he and Kasen were officially mated."Neither do I," the cat-man grinned.The smile made Kasen shudder. It was slow, sensual and filled with heat. He watched wide-eyed as Dayd's naked body was revealed to him for the first time. His eyes took in the broad, furred chest, the tapering waist, the slim hips and the furred genital pouch. He was mesmerised as Dayd's hand reached to free his sex and could not prevent the soft gasp. The shaft that was revealed was long and thick. Kasen had never seen such a magnificent erection. Then, before he could get too intimidated, Dayd was in the water.Kasen was barely aware of the whimpers that fell from his lips as he hurried to strip. As soon as the last piece of clothing fell to the floor he dived after the elusive PrideHomer. Arousal was temporarily forgotten as Kasen chased Dayd, only for the cat-man to submerge and swim powerfully away to re-emerge in another part of the lake. Panting and treading water Kasen looked around for a sign of Dayd, frowning when he saw no sign of the PrideHomer. Then he let out a near-scream as strong arms wrapped around his waist lifting him with ease. Before his indignation could find words, Kasen was spun to face a laughing Dayd and then lowered quickly until their lips were millimetres apart.The laughter ceased as the two men stilled and gazed into each other's eyes. Dayd could scent Kasen's arousal and feel hard flesh pressing into his abdomen. As if they had both heard a signal, the distance closed and their lips met. Dayd kept the kiss light and then nibbled and licked across the lips of his mate-to-be.The soft groan ensured the blond's mouth opened and Dayd thrust eagerly inside to taste and claim that which was his. His tongue slid over cheeks and teeth before sucking Kasen's conquered muscle into his own mouth to complete the willing ravishment. Only breaking the shared kisses for the barest of breaths, the cat-man carried the slighter form to the bank and laid Kasen on soft, fragrant grass.The bigger man lay between Kasen's spread thighs, his greater weight balanced on strong forearms as he gazed down at the blond. Scent, sensation, sound and sight all told the PrideHomer what he needed to know. Musk and arousal were thick in the air, the frantic rise and fall of Kasen's chest caused it to occasionally brush across his furred torso, hard flesh at Kasen's groin lay alongside his own leaking shaft, there was a melodic litany of panting breaths and needy whimpers and the blond's eyes were so dilated that the blue was a deep indigo.All his instincts were driving him to mate, but the cat-man forced himself to hold back for a few seconds more."Are you sure?" he panted harshly. "Do you understand and accept that once this step is taken you are my mate. Only mine, for life?""Yes," Kasen moaned. "Yes, yes. Want you, want this. Please, Dayd, I want to be yours."Dayd let his instincts take over. He closed his eyes and inhaled deeply. His nostrils flared as he took in the scent of the body beneath him. He followed one specific, alluring scent until his nose was buried in it. Then his tongue slid out, adding taste to scent. Instantly addicted, he thrust his tongue forward again and again. A low moan reached his ears and he added sound. Rapid panting, low moans and soft groans together with a rapid heartbeat created a rhapsody of arousal.His hands roamed over heated flesh, the different textures making his skin tingle. Finally, he added sight to stare at the opening to Kasen's body, wet and slick with his saliva. He growled his approval. Temporarily abandoning the desired portal to a whine of distress from the younger male, he moved to Kasen's mouth. At first it was a gentle kiss. But then, at Kasen's choked plea, Dayd deepened the kiss.He met the blond's eyes. For several moments, they simply stared at each other. Then, as if knowing that Dayd needed permission once more, Kasen nodded slightly.Dayd closed his eyes. When he opened them they were feral. With a growl, he lunged down, biting and sucking at Kasen's vulnerable throat to a cry that was part pleasure, part pain as fragile flesh was bruised and broken. Dayd then moved back down Kasen's body to lick, suck and nip with ferocity as he marked his mate. He sucked in the hot flesh that dripped its need, letting his tongue learn its taste and texture. He held down bucking hips as Kasen thrashed and tugged at the suede-like sac when he sensed his mate was too close. Finally he moved to the core of his desire, his tongue plunging into Kasen's body once more, wetting and stretching. Everything else ceased to exist.<br/>"Love me, Dayd," Kasen begged, need and want like a fire in his veins. He moaned at the exquisite feeling of pressure as Dayd's long, thick erection pressed against his most intimate entrance. It made him shiver in ecstasy."I do, dear sweet Kasen," Dayd replied as he sealed his mouth over Kasen's, kneeling between Kasen's legs, lifting the blond's hips to rest on his thighs. He pressed harder against the tight rosette."More Dayd," Kasen pleaded, his voice rough with passion.Dayd growled low and feral as he slid all the way inside and stilled, remaining motionless although he felt it was almost beyond him to do so. The tightness made him groan as every inch of his flesh was encased by his mate's flexing and relaxing sheath. Reaching the end of his endurance, Dayd angled himself to find the spot that he thought would give the most pleasure and rotated his hips.In response Kasen wailed, arching his head back to expose the cords in his neck, writhing on the grass. A triumphant smile lit over Dayd's features as he pulled his hips back and slammed that spot again, his fingers grasped tightly at Kasen's thighs to pull his lover into every thrust."More, Dayd, more," Kasen whispered. He reached up and cupped Dayd's cheeks in his fingers, pulling him down, his tongue flicking against the big male's lower lip. Incoherent groans left Kasen's throat as Dayd thrust faster and deeper in response. He wrapped his legs tighter around Dayd's hips, meeting his mate's thrusts to get more of the sensation that raced like molten fire in his veins. Searing heat rippled through his groin as Dayd pushed inside, pounding into him, hitting his sweet spot over and over.Dayd gave a sound between purr and growl as he thrust back and forth inside the hot, tight channel. The PrideHomer felt Kasen flex around his shaft as their mouths met in heated passion, tongues dancing in an age-old rhythm. Dayd pulled Kasen closer, growling deeply into the blond's mouth. Then, gripping the slender hips of the young man beneath him he tilted them upwards, the angle allowing him to thrust even deeper, stroking across Kasen's jewel with renewed vigour."So good, my sweet Kasen," he husked, his passion edging him to the point at which he knew he would be beyond coherent thought much less speech. Dayd reached for Kasen's erection and stroked it at the same pulse-racing pace. Sweat dripped from his pores as he strained over his lover, his hard muscles sharply defined by the sheen of perspiration.Kasen's loins tightened and heat spread throughout his hypersensitive body as Dayd stroked his sweet spot and shaft with perfect precision. His eyes fluttered closed, his body twitching uncontrollably as Dayd played him masterfully, guiding him towards their shared zenith. Nothing he had ever experienced before could compare with the exquisite sensations Dayd engendered. Kasen knew beyond doubt that the man pleasuring him was the other half of his soul."Fill me, Dayd," he pleaded. "I want to give you pleasure." Kasen groaned as he leaned up and captured Dayd's mouth, the bigger male instantly ravishing him with his teeth and tongue."You are my pleasure, only you," Dayd whispered as he broke the kiss for a brief second. His tongue then swept imperiously into Kasen's conquered mouth. Kissing Kasen was so addictive that Dayd never wanted to stop. He began to thrust faster and harder, Kasen's whimpering mewls urging him on. He growled and groaned with the sublime pleasure.As Dayd stroked his mate's staff, Kasen's body quivered even more. The cat-man could feel and scent how close his lover was. The hardness in his hand was slick with liquid need and it throbbed with the same beat as their pounding hearts.Kasen's muscles were tight and quivering and he felt like a volcano ready to erupt. One final thrust against his prostrate and he came in great convulsive heaves, screaming Dayd's name, his cream pouring over Dayd's demanding hand. Kasen felt delirious from the joy coursing through his veins. Dayd's hot juices flooded his contracting channel and the flames of desire that had been burning within him flared high taking him to a place he had only dreamt of. He lay, trying to regain his breath his body still convulsing with aftershocks from the intense orgasm,Kasen's convulsions pushed Dayd beyond his tenuous control. He threw back his head and roared as he came deep inside of the young man beneath him and filled Kasen with his seed. Collapsing partially atop his mate, Dayd shook in reaction from the cataclysmic release. He wrapped one arm around his young lover, holding him and stroking his flank with the other as the blond came down from his euphoric high. He moved his nose and lips against Kasen's throat, biting there harshly, marking the blond once more as his."You look so beautiful in your pleasure, Kasen." Dayd whispered. He continued to move slowly, languidly, into Kasen's sated body. He raised his fingers, coated with Kasen's crème to his mouth. "Look at me," he commanded.The young man's eyes fluttered open briefly and he watched as Dayd began to lick each finger clean, the primal gesture making his sated cock twitch dryly. As the last digit left Dayd's mouth, Kasen finally surrendered to oblivion.****Kasen had no idea how much time had passed when he next opened his eyes. He smiled into the furred chest he was pillowed upon and teasingly suckled at the cinnamon nub that peeked through caramel fur. He grinned at his mate as Dayd's purrs deepened. Then a thought hit the blond."When do we have to leave? You need to get ready for the naming ceremony." Kasen was not sure if his new status with Dayd made him more aware of the PrideHomer's mood, but he knew instantly that his lover was discomfited by the question."No rush," Dayd said. He had known this moment would come, but the PrideHomer still tried to avoid it."This is something really special," Kasen persisted. "Sholto told me that even the patriarchs and matriarchs of the Prides your family marry into make the effort to attend a naming. Uist is your cousin. I know this is important to you.""We will not be attending," Dayd said, deciding it was no longer appropriate to be anything other than open with the man he had just taken as his mate."Theophilus doesn't want me there does he? This is his doing," Kasen said angrily."No it is not," Dayd growled immediately.Kasen blinked at the tears that suddenly filled his eyes. In the months they had spent together Dayd had never raised his voice or spoken so sharply before. He did not resist as strong hands pulled him to nestle against Dayd's neck and sweet musk filled the air around him."Oh, my beautiful Kasen," Dayd said, his voice soft and sad. "You hadn't mixed with any non-human types before you met us had you?" He gave a half-smile at the shake of the blond head. "PrideHomers and Phixians, and to some degree Dregans, we may look very different but share one trait that is important here. We do not just use sight. We use scent. You may have schooled your face to be neutral, but your anger and...your hate...towards Theophilus has been scented by us all. Theophilus also has strong empathic qualities, he knows how you feel. He is confused. He doesn't understand why you hate him. He may have more years of life than you, but you are actually more mature. He is not long classed as fully adult.""You scent me," Kasen murmured from the sanctuary of Dayd's chest. He knew it happened but somehow it had never registered, just what scenting actually meant. How much his real emotions were open to the PrideHomers."Yes, my sweet one. I, all my family, Xavier, we have all known your true feelings and hoped you would realise you are angry towards one who has done nothing. Theophilus argued we had to go to the naming. He has been unwavering in the belief you and I would mate. He said we remind him of Uist and Sholto and I could not ask for a better compliment. It was not he who decreed we must remain absent. It was Willis and my Sire. They used the one thing against which even Theophilus had no answer. The three little ones, today is their special day. Everyone wants them to be happy. They might be babies, Kasen, but they can scent and they can feel. You cannot have failed to notice they cry when you are near Theophilus?" Dayd asked, pushing at Kasen's shoulders to look at his mate."I thought it was just a baby thing," Kasen whispered. Shame permeated every cell as he had the sickening notion that he knew what Dayd was about to say."They might not understand what it is you feel towards Theophilus, but they know it upsets him and that upsets them. They scent you, too and react the only way babies can, with tears.""Oh, Dayd, I've been such a fool. I was so shocked when I saw Theophilus. As bad as it was Jabez snatched me, I thought it was because he found me attractive. Then I realised it was because I reminded him of someone else. I got so twisted inside that it just became easy to take my anger and frustration and...hate out on the one I could reach. I knew it hurt him and I got a perverted sense of satisfaction from it." Kasen buried his face in Dayd's chest. "What can I do?""Apologise," Dayd said simply. He heard the half-laugh, half-sob that greeted his reply and pushed Kasen up to look at him again. "Theophilus is the most generous-hearted person I know. If your apology is sincere he will accept it and forget the past.""You love him don't you?" Kasen asked."Yes," Dayd said. "But I am not, nor ever have been, in love with him. That part of me is for you alone." Dayd reached to stroke the silken strands of the blond bob."You miss my long hair, too.""I would have been happy had you cut it, no matter my preference, because it was what you wanted. Not because you thought people saw Theophilus when they looked at you. Although I recognised where the similarity between the two of you lay, it was your blue eyes that I truly noticed.""I want to apologise to him, Dayd. Perhaps you can still go to the naming," Kasen said with determination, touched by his lover's simple declaration. He trusted Dayd to speak the truth."We both go or we both stay away," Dayd said emphatically. "We are mated. One does not go without the other.****Xavier's tongue flickered in the air before he drew it back. He glanced at where his young husband lay on a sumptuous nest. Two little ones were curled against his right side and, although asleep, clutched at each other and Theophilus. The third, currently at his breast, was Rayner and Tristam's, the tiny telepath needing a mental connection as well as physical when feeding.Theophilus was humming softly; one hand occasionally brushing over the two sleeping infants, the other holding the third safe. Xavier recognised the approaching scents. He rose slowly to greet them. The anxiety from Kasen was pouring off him in waves, as was shame. Xavier prayed it boded well. He would not permit a young and foolish human to ruin this day."Dayd, Kasen," he greeted them, a comfortable distance from his mate. "May I help you?""I want to apologise to Theophilus," Kasen blurted quickly. "I'm so sorry. Please?""He is still feeding," Xavier demurred. He looked between the fretful human and the now clearly anxious PrideHomer. He knew what his husband would want. "However, if you do not disturb them, I am sure he will be pleased to see you.""Thank you, Xavier," Kasen said, relief evident in his voice. He took a few hesitant steps forward. Now it came to it, he was completely uncertain how to approach the recumbent blond."Kasen, you are mated. I am so pleased for you."Kasen stared at Theophilus, stunned that the other blond was still so gracious despite his previously hurtful behaviour. He found his eyes brimming with tears once more."Come here, little one," Theophilus urged. He smiled reassuringly as Kasen came first to kneel, then to stretch out at his left side.Kasen was surprised when a deceptively-slender, strong arm wrapped around him, holding him comfortingly. He managed to murmur a half-sobbed apology as he was rocked gently whilst cleansing tears fell. A soft humming accompanied the soothing motion and occasional kisses were pressed into his hair. He found himself burrowing close, the sweet smell of the other blond like a balm to his nerves. Finally, a persistent butting made Kasen open his eyes and pull back from Theophilus' side. His own eyes widened as he was regarded intently by three sets of curious orbs."Your cousins would like to meet you, Kasen," Theophilus said smiling widely. "This is Uist and Sholto's son." He indicated the child closest to Kasen, a light covering of reddish-blond down adorning his body. "He will try and use his scent glands although they will not produce musk until his puberty," Theophilus laughed. "And because he will, so will these two even though they have no such glands. This little one is Rayner and Tristam's and this is Xavier's and mine."The second child had dark blond hair and large dark eyes that made Kasen feel the infant was staring into his heart and soul. The third had a short mop of platinum-blond hair, a tiny frill was beginning around his neck which was currently lilac and amber, vertically slit eyes. His tail kept in constant touch with the other two children and Theophilus. Kasen swallowed as he was then the subject of very close scrutiny as first one, then all three children made their way onto him.****Tristam, Rayner, Sholto and Uist stopped and grinned at the sight before them. On the large nest, Dayd and Kasen played with the three small children who all demanded equal and constant attention. Xavier lay back against a tree trunk watching whilst his tail gently rocked a hammock in which Theophilus lay."So this is how you care for our cubs?" Uist asked with an amused growl. "By lazing around." As he spoke he reached effortlessly into the hammock to lift the slender blond form and spin Theophilus around earning delighted peals of musical laughter."The little ones wished to get to know their cousins," Theophilus countered as he was set on his feet, kissing each of his family in turn."Do you want to get to know them really well and take on nappy duties?" Sholto asked hopefully. The dismay on Kasen and Dayd's faces had him laughing along with the others. "Guess not. Hey, I tried, guys," he added."They cannot," Theophilus said as he reached to help the small, blond human and his PrideHomer mate to their feet. "We have to see Willis and Denys. They have an announcement to make.""They make a good pair," Uist announced, his purrs rumbling deep in his chest as he watched Dayd and Kasen be led away by an excited Theophilus, Xavier following behind. "It is good Kasen has settled."****Willis stood proudly before the gathering of his family and friends, ready to officially name the newest members of his Pride. The three couples stood before him, their small bundles behaving impeccably for the moment."Welcome to you all," he rumbled. "Today we have our naming ceremony for the young ones. Firstly, the cub of my cub, I welcome Keefe to the Pride." The cat-man added his own roar to that of the gathered assembly as Uist held his son high, then laughed delightedly as Keefe tried to imitate the sound. "Secondly, although the first-born of my three grandchildren, I welcome Zene to the Pride." Another roar accompanied Xavier raising his son. "Finally I welcome Marnin to the Pride." He nodded approvingly at the roar, waiting for the six, plus their infants, to take their seats.Willis could see people looking at him with interest; clearly certain more was to come. He smiled widely."I have good news for the Pride. My sibling's youngest cub has chosen a mate. Dayd has chosen Kasen of Earth."His smile turned tender as the small blond blushed crimson, trying to bury himself against Dayd's solidity as he was encouraged to stand and accept the endorsement from the gathered PrideHomers. Willis nodded at Denys. His eyes then sought out Laban, receiving a nod from the Phixian."My last piece of good news is from our extended Pride. Laban wishes me to announce that Meta, daughter of his sibling, is to be married to Alden who helped rescue Uist, Sholto and Theophilus when they were kidnapped."The last roar seemed to echo longest, a mixture of approval and gratitude expressed in the sound. Willis looked around. His six boys were surrounded by family and friends, as were Dayd and Kasen, Alden and Meta. He felt the strong grip at his shoulder and pulled his brother into a hug.For now, at least, all danger was past and everyone could enjoy peace and joy.
